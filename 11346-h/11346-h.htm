<h1>THE SAINT&rsquo;S TRAGEDY</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PREFACE BY THE REV. F. D. MAURICE, M.A. (1848)</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The writer of this play does not differ with his countrymen generally,
as to the nature and requirements of a Drama.&nbsp; He has learnt from
our Great Masters that it should exhibit human beings engaged in some
earnest struggle, certain outward aspects of which may possibly be a
spectacle for the amusement of idlers, but which in itself is for the
study and the sympathy of those who are struggling themselves.&nbsp;
A Drama, he feels, should not aim at the inculcation of any definite
maxim; the moral of it lies in the action and the character.&nbsp; It
must be drawn out of them by the heart and experience of the reader,
not forced upon him by the author.&nbsp; The men and women whom he presents
are not to be his spokesmen; they are to utter themselves freely in
such language, grave or mirthful, as best expresses what they feel and
what they are.&nbsp; The age to which they belong is not to be contemplated
as if it were apart from us; neither is it to be measured by our rules;
to be held up as a model; to be condemned for its strangeness.&nbsp;
The passions which worked in it must be those which are working in ourselves.&nbsp;
To the same eternal laws and principles are we, and it, amenable.&nbsp;
By beholding these a poet is to raise himself, and may hope to raise
his readers, above antiquarian tastes and modern conventions.&nbsp;
The unity of the play cannot be conferred upon it by any artificial
arrangements; it must depend upon the relation of the different persons
and events to the central subject.&nbsp; No nice adjustments of success
and failure to right and wrong must constitute its poetical justice;
the conscience of the readers must be satisfied in some deeper way than
this, that there is an order in the universe, and that the poet has
perceived and asserted it.</p>
<p>Long before these principles were reduced into formal canons of orthodoxy,
even while they encountered the strong opposition of critics, they were
unconsciously recognised by Englishmen as sound and national.&nbsp;
Yet I question whether a clergyman writing in conformity with them might
not have incurred censure in former times, and may not incur it now.&nbsp;
The privilege of expressing his own thoughts, sufferings, sympathies,
in any form of verse is easily conceded to him; if he liked to use a
dialogue instead of a monologue, for the purpose of enforcing a duty,
or illustrating a doctrine, no one would find fault with him; if he
produced an actual Drama for the purpose of defending or denouncing
a particular character, or period, or system of opinions, the compliments
of one party might console him for the abuse or contempt of another.</p>
<p>But it seems to be supposed that he is bound to keep in view one
or other of these ends: to divest himself of his own individuality that
he may enter into the working of other spirits; to lay aside the authority
which pronounces one opinion, or one habit of mind, to be right and
another wrong, that he may exhibit them in their actual strife; to deal
with questions, not in an abstract shape, but mixed up with the affections,
passions, relations of human creatures, is a course which must lead
him, it is thought, into a great forgetfulness of his office, and of
all that is involved in it.</p>
<p>No one can have less interest than I have in claiming poetical privileges
for the clergy; and no one, I believe, is more thoroughly convinced
that the standard which society prescribes for us, and to which we ordinarily
conform ourselves, instead of being too severe and lofty, is far too
secular and grovelling.&nbsp; But I apprehend the limitations of this
kind which are imposed upon us are themselves exceedingly secular, betokening
an entire misconception of the nature of our work, proceeding from maxims
and habits which tend to make it utterly insignificant and abortive.&nbsp;
If a man confines himself to the utterance of his own experiences, those
experiences are likely to become every day more narrow and less real.&nbsp;
If he confines himself to the defence of certain propositions, he is
sure gradually to lose all sense of the connection between those propositions
and his own life, or the life of man.&nbsp; In either case he becomes
utterly ineffectual as a teacher.&nbsp; Those whose education and character
are different from his own, whose processes of mind have therefore been
different, are utterly unintelligible to him.&nbsp; Even a cordial desire
for sympathy is not able to break through the prickly hedge of habits,
notions, and technicalities which separates them.&nbsp; Oftentimes the
desire itself is extinguished in those who ought to cherish it most,
by the fear of meeting with something portentous or dangerous.&nbsp;
Nor can he defend a dogma better than he communes with men; for he knows
not that which attacks it.&nbsp; He supposes it to be a set of book
arguments, whereas it is something lying very deep in the heart of the
disputant, into which he has never penetrated.</p>
<p>Hence there is a general complaint that we &lsquo;are ignorant of
the thoughts and feelings of our contemporaries&rsquo;; most attribute
this to a fear of looking below the surface, lest we should find hollowness
within; many like to have it so, because they have thus an excuse for
despising us.&nbsp; But surely such an ignorance is more inexcusable
in us, than in the priests of any nation: we, less than any, are kept
from the sun and air; our discipline is less than any contrived merely
to make us acquainted with the commonplaces of divinity.&nbsp; We are
enabled, nay, obliged, from our youth upwards, to mix with people of
our own age, who are destined for all occupations and modes of life;
to share in their studies, their enjoyments, their perplexities, their
temptations.&nbsp; Experience, often so dearly bought, is surely not
meant to be thrown away: whether it has been obtained without the sacrifice
of that which is most precious, or whether the lost blessing has been
restored twofold, and good is understood, not only as the opposite of
evil, but as the deliverance from it, we cannot be meant to forget all
that we have been learning.&nbsp; The teachers of other nations may
reasonably mock us, as having less of direct book-lore than themselves;
they should not be able to say, that we are without the compensation
of knowing a little more of living creatures.</p>
<p>A clergyman, it seems to me, should be better able than other men
to cast aside that which is merely accidental, either in his own character,
or in the character of the age to which he belongs, and to apprehend
that which is essential and eternal.&nbsp; His acceptance of fixed creeds,
which belong as much to one generation as another, and which have survived
amid all changes and convulsions, should raise him especially above
the temptation to exalt the fashion of his own time, or of any past
one; above the affectation of the obsolete, above slavery to the present,
and above that strange mixture of both which some display, who weep
because the beautiful visions of the Past are departed, and admire themselves
for being able to weep over them&mdash;and dispense with them.&nbsp;
His reverence for the Bible should make him feel that we most realise
our own personality when we most connect it with that of our fellow-men;
that acts are not to be contemplated apart from the actor; that more
of what is acceptable to the God of Truth may come forth in men striving
with infinite confusion, and often uttering words like the east-wind,
than in those who can discourse calmly and eloquently about a righteousness
and mercy, which they know only by hearsay.&nbsp; The belief which a
minister of God has in the eternity of the distinction between right
and wrong should especially dispose him to recognise that distinction
apart from mere circumstance and opinion.&nbsp; The confidence which
he must have that the life of each man, and the life of this world,
is a drama, in which a perfectly Good and True Being is unveiling His
own purposes, and carrying on a conflict with evil, which must issue
in complete victory, should make him eager to discover in every portion
of history, in every biography, a divine &lsquo;Morality&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Mystery&rsquo;&mdash;a morality, though it deals with no abstract
personages&mdash;a mystery, though the subject of it be the doings of
the most secular men.</p>
<p>The subject of this Play is certainly a dangerous one, it suggests
questions which are deeply interesting at the present time.&nbsp; It
involves the whole character and spirit of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; A
person who had not an enthusiastic admiration for the character of Elizabeth
would not be worthy to speak of her; it seems to me, that he would be
still less worthy, if he did not admire far more fervently that ideal
of the female character which God has established, and not man&mdash;which
she imperfectly realised&mdash;which often exhibited itself in her in
spite of her own more confused, though apparently more lofty, ideal;
which may be manifested more simply, and therefore more perfectly, in
the England of the nineteenth century, than in the Germany of the thirteenth.&nbsp;
To enter into the meaning of self-sacrifice&mdash;to sympathise with
any one who aims at it&mdash;not to be misled by counterfeits of it&mdash;not
to be unjust to the truth which may be mixed with those counterfeits&mdash;is
a difficult task, but a necessary one for any one who takes this work
in hand.&nbsp; How far our author has attained these ends, others must
decide.&nbsp; I am sure that he will not have failed from forgetting
them.&nbsp; He has, I believe, faithfully studied all the documents
of the period within his reach, making little use of modern narratives;
he has meditated upon the past in its connection with the present; has
never allowed his reading to become dry by disconnecting it with what
he has seen and felt, or made his partial experiences a measure for
the acts which they help him to understand.&nbsp; He has entered upon
his work at least in a true and faithful spirit, not regarding it as
an amusement for leisure hours, but as something to be done seriously,
if done at all; as if he was as much &lsquo;under the Great Taskmaster&rsquo;s
eye&rsquo; in this as in any other duty of his calling.&nbsp; In certain
passages and scenes he seemed to me to have been a little too bold for
the taste and temper of this age.&nbsp; But having written them deliberately,
from a conviction that morality is in peril from fastidiousness, and
that it is not safe to look at questions which are really agitating
people&rsquo;s hearts merely from the outside&mdash;he has, and I believe
rightly, retained what I should from cowardice have wished him to exclude.&nbsp;
I have no doubt, that any one who wins a victory over the fear of opinion,
and especially over the opinion of the religious world, strengthens
his own moral character, and acquires a greater fitness for his high
service.</p>
<p>Whether Poetry is again to revive among us, or whether the power
is to be wholly stifled by our accurate notions about the laws and conditions
under which it is to be exercised, is a question upon which there is
room for great differences of opinion.&nbsp; Judging from the past,
I should suppose that till Poetry becomes less self-conscious, less
self-concentrated, more <i>dramatical</i> in spirit, if not in form,
it will not have the qualities which can powerfully affect Englishmen.&nbsp;
Not only were the Poets of our most national age dramatists, but there
seems an evident dramatical tendency in those who wrote what we are
wont to call narrative, or epic, poems.&nbsp; Take away the dramatic
faculty from Chaucer, and the <i>Canterbury</i> <i>Tales</i> become
indeed, what they have been most untruly called, mere versions of French
or Italian Fables.&nbsp; Milton may have been right in changing the
form of the <i>Paradise</i> <i>Lost</i>,&mdash;we are bound to believe
that he was right; for what appeal can there be against his genius?&nbsp;
But he could not destroy the essentially dramatic character of a work
which sets forth the battle between good and evil, and the Will of Man
at once the Theatre and the Prize of the conflict.&nbsp; Is it not true,
that there is in the very substance of the English mind, that which
naturally predisposes us to sympathy with the Drama, and this though
we are perhaps the most untheatrical of all people?&nbsp; The love of
action, the impatience of abstraction, the equity which leads us to
desire that every one may have a fair hearing, the reserve which had
rather detect personal experience than have it announced&mdash;tendencies
all easily perverted to evil, often leading to results the most contradictory,
yet capable of the noblest cultivation&mdash;seem to explain the fact,
that writers of this kind should have flourished so greatly among us,
and that scarcely any others should permanently interest us.</p>
<p>These remarks do not concern poetical literature alone, or chiefly.&nbsp;
Those habits of mind, of which I have spoken, ought to make us the best
<i>historians</i>.&nbsp; If Germany has a right to claim the whole realm
of the abstract, if Frenchmen understand the framework of society better
than we do, there is in the national dramas of Shakespeare an historical
secret, which neither the philosophy of the one nor the acute observation
of the other can discover.&nbsp; Yet these dramas are almost the only
satisfactory expression of that historical faculty which I believe is
latent in us.&nbsp; The zeal of our factions, a result of our national
activity, has made earnest history dishonest: our English justice has
fled to indifferent and sceptical writers for the impartiality which
it sought in vain elsewhere.&nbsp; This resource has failed,&mdash;the
indifferentism of Hume could not secure him against his Scotch prejudices,
or against gross unfairness when anything disagreeably positive and
vehement came in his way.&nbsp; Moreover, a practical people demand
movement and life, not mere judging and balancing.&nbsp; For a time
there was a reaction in favour of party history, but it could not last
long; already we are glad to seek in Ranke or Michelet that which seems
denied us at home.&nbsp; Much, no doubt, may be gained from such sources;
but I am convinced that <i>this</i> is not the produce which we are
meant generally to import; for this we may trust to well-directed native
industry.&nbsp; The time is, I hope, at hand, when those who are most
in earnest will feel that therefore they are most bound to be just&mdash;when
they will confess the exceeding wickedness of the desire to distort
or suppress a fact, or misrepresent a character&mdash;when they will
ask as solemnly to be delivered from the temptation to this, as to any
crime which is punished by law.</p>
<p>The clergy ought especially to lead the way in this reformation.&nbsp;
They have erred grievously in perverting history to their own purposes.&nbsp;
What was a sin in others was in them a blasphemy, because they professed
to acknowledge God as the Ruler of the world, and hereby they showed
that they valued their own conclusions above the facts which reveal
His order.&nbsp; They owe, therefore, a great <i>amende</i> to their
country, and they should consider seriously how they can make it most
effectually.&nbsp; I look upon this Play as an effort in this direction,
which I trust may be followed by many more.&nbsp; On this ground alone,
even if its poetical worth was less than I believe it is, I should,
as a clergyman, be thankful for its publication.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The story which I have here put into a dramatic form is one familiar
to Romanists, and perfectly and circumstantially authenticated.&nbsp;
Abridged versions of it, carefully softened and sentimentalised, may
be read in any Romish collection of Lives of the Saints.&nbsp; An enlarged
edition has been published in France, I believe by Count Montalembert,
and translated, with illustrations, by an English gentleman, which admits
certain miraculous legends, of later date, and, like other prodigies,
worthless to the student of human character.&nbsp; From consulting this
work I have hitherto abstained, in order that I might draw my facts
and opinions, entire and unbiassed, from the original Biography of Elizabeth,
by Dietrich of Appold, her contemporary, as given entire by Canisius.</p>
<p>Dietrich was born in Thuringia, near the scene of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
labours, a few years before her death; had conversed with those who
had seen her, and calls to witness &lsquo;God and the elect angels,&rsquo;
that he had inserted nothing but what he had either understood from
religious and veracious persons, or read in approved writings, viz.
&lsquo;<i>The</i> <i>Book</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Sayings</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Elizabeth&rsquo;s</i> <i>Four</i> <i>Ladies</i> (<i>Guta</i>, <i>Isentrudis</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>two</i> <i>others</i>)&rsquo;; &lsquo;<i>The</i> <i>Letter</i>
<i>which</i> <i>Conrad</i> <i>of</i> <i>Marpurg</i>, <i>her</i> <i>Director</i>,
<i>wrote</i> <i>to</i> <i>Pope</i> <i>Gregory</i> <i>the</i> <i>Ninth</i>&rsquo;
(these two documents still exist); &lsquo;<i>The</i> <i>Sermon</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Otto</i>&rsquo; (<i>de</i> <i>Ordine</i> <i>Pr&aelig;dic</i>), which
begins thus: &lsquo;<i>Mulierem fortem</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not satisfied with these,&rsquo; he &lsquo;visited monasteries,
castles, and towns, interrogated the most aged and veracious persons,
and wrote letters, seeking for completeness and truth in all things;&rsquo;
and thus composed his biography, from which that in Surius (<i>Acta</i>
<i>Sanctorum</i>), Jacobus de Voragine, Alban Butler, and all others
which I have seen, are copied with a very few additions and many prudent
omissions.</p>
<p>Wishing to adhere strictly to historical truth, I have followed the
received account, not only in the incidents, but often in the language
which it attributes to its various characters; and have given in the
Notes all necessary references to the biography in Canisius&rsquo;s
collection.&nbsp; My part has therefore been merely to show how the
conduct of my heroine was not only possible, but to a certain degree
necessary, for a character of earnestness and piety such as hers, working
under the influences of the Middle Age.</p>
<p>In deducing fairly, from the phenomena of her life, the character
of Elizabeth, she necessarily became a type of two great mental struggles
of the Middle Age; first, of that between Scriptural or unconscious,
and Popish or conscious, purity: in a word, between innocence and prudery;
next, of the struggle between healthy human affection, and the Manichean
contempt with which a celibate clergy would have all men regard the
names of husband, wife, and parent.&nbsp; To exhibit this latter falsehood
in its miserable consequences, when received into a heart of insight
and determination sufficient to follow out all belief to its ultimate
practice, is the main object of my Poem.&nbsp; That a most degrading
and agonising contradiction on these points must have existed in the
mind of Elizabeth, and of all who with similar characters shall have
found themselves under similar influences, is a necessity that must
be evident to all who know anything of the deeper affections of men.&nbsp;
In the idea of a married Romish saint, these miseries should follow
logically from the Romish view of human relations.&nbsp; In Elizabeth&rsquo;s
case their existence is proved equally logically from the acknowledged
facts of her conduct.</p>
<p>I may here observe, that if I have in no case made her allude to
the Virgin Mary, and exhibited the sense of infinite duty and loyalty
to Christ alone, as the mainspring of all her noblest deeds, it is merely
in accordance with Dietrich&rsquo;s biography.&nbsp; The omission of
all Mariolatry is remarkable.&nbsp; My business is to copy that omission,
as I should in the opposite case have copied the introduction of Virgin-worship
into the original tale.&nbsp; The business of those who make Mary, to
women especially, the complete substitute for the Saviour&mdash;I had
almost said, for all Three Persons of the Trinity&mdash;is to explain,
if they can, her non-appearance in this case.</p>
<p>Lewis, again, I have drawn as I found him, possessed of all virtues
but those of action; in knowledge, in moral courage, in spiritual attainment,
infinitely inferior to his wife, and depending on her to be taught to
pray; giving her higher faculties nothing to rest on in himself, and
leaving the noblest offices of a husband to be supplied by a spiritual
director.&nbsp; He thus becomes a type of the husbands of the Middle
Age, and of the woman-worship of chivalry.&nbsp; Woman-worship, &lsquo;the
honour due to the weaker vessel,&rsquo; is indeed of God, and woe to
the nation and to the man in whom it dies.&nbsp; But in the Middle Age,
this feeling had no religious root, by which it could connect itself
rationally, either with actual wedlock or with the noble yearnings of
men&rsquo;s spirits, and it therefore could not but die down into a
semi-sensual dream of female-saint-worship, or fantastic idolatry of
mere physical beauty, leaving the women themselves an easy prey to the
intellectual allurements of the more educated and subtle priesthood.</p>
<p>In Conrad&rsquo;s case, again, I have fancied that I discover in
the various notices of his life a noble nature warped and blinded by
its unnatural exclusions from those family ties through which we first
discern or describe God and our relations to Him, and forced to concentrate
his whole faculties in the service, not so much of a God of Truth as
of a Catholic system.&nbsp; In his character will be found, I hope,
some implicit apology for the failings of such truly great men as Dunstan,
Becket, and Dominic, and of many more whom, if we hate, we shall never
understand, while we shall be but too likely, in our own way, to copy
them.</p>
<p>Walter of Varila, a more fictitious character, represents the &lsquo;healthy
animalism&rsquo; of the Teutonic mind, with its mixture of deep earnestness
and hearty merriment.&nbsp; His dislike of priestly sentimentalities
is no anachronism.&nbsp; Even in his day, a noble lay-religion, founded
on faith in the divine and universal symbolism of humanity and nature,
was gradually arising, and venting itself, from time to time, as I conceive,
through many most unsuspected channels, through chivalry, through the
minne-singers, through the lay inventors, or rather importers, of pointed
architecture, through the German school of painting, through the politics
of the free towns, till it attained complete freedom in Luther and his
associate reformers.</p>
<p>For my fantastic quotations of Scripture, if they shall be deemed
irreverent, I can only say, that they were the fashion of the time,
from prince to peasant&mdash;that there is scarcely one of them with
which I have not actually met in the writings of the period&mdash;that
those writings abound with misuse of Scripture, far more coarse, arbitrary,
and ridiculous, than any which I have dared to insert&mdash;that I had
no right to omit so radical a characteristic of the Middle Age.</p>
<p>For the more coarse and homely passages with which the drama is interspersed,
I must make the same apology.&nbsp; I put them there because they were
there&mdash;because the Middle Age was, in the gross, a coarse, barbarous,
and profligate age&mdash;because it was necessary, in order to bring
out fairly the beauty of the central character, to show &lsquo;the crooked
and perverse generation&rsquo; in which she was &lsquo;a child of God
without rebuke.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was, in fact, the very ferocity and
foulness of the time which, by a natural revulsion, called forth at
the same time the Apostolic holiness and the Manichean asceticism of
the Medi&aelig;val Saints.&nbsp; The world was so bad that, to be Saints
at all, they were compelled to go out of the world.&nbsp; It was necessary,
moreover, in depicting the poor man&rsquo;s patroness, to show the material
on which she worked; and those who know the poor, know also that we
can no more judge truly of their characters in the presence of their
benefactors, than we can tell by seeing clay in the potter&rsquo;s hands
what it was in its native pit.&nbsp; These scenes have, therefore, been
laid principally in Elizabeth&rsquo;s absence, in order to preserve
their only use and meaning.</p>
<p>So rough and common a life-picture of the Middle Age will, I am afraid,
whether faithful or not, be far from acceptable to those who take their
notions of that period principally from such exquisite dreams as the
fictions of Fouqu&eacute;, and of certain moderns whose graceful minds,
like some enchanted well,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In whose calm depths the pure and beautiful<br />Alone are mirrored,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>are, on account of their very sweetness and simplicity, singularly
unfitted to convey any true likeness of the coarse and stormy Middle
Age.&nbsp; I have been already accused, by others than Romanists, of
profaning this whole subject&mdash;<i>i.e</i>. of telling the whole
truth, pleasant or not, about it.&nbsp; But really, time enough has
been lost in ignorant abuse of that period, and time enough also, lately,
in blind adoration of it.&nbsp; When shall we learn to see it as it
was?&mdash;the dawning manhood of Europe&mdash;rich with all the tenderness,
the simplicity, the enthusiasm of youth&mdash;but also darkened, alas!
with its full share of youth&rsquo;s precipitance and extravagance,
fierce passions and blind self-will&mdash;its virtues and its vices
colossal, and, for that very reason, always haunted by the twin-imp
of the colossal&mdash;the caricatured.</p>
<p>Lastly, the many miraculous stories which the biographer of Elizabeth
relates of her, I had no right, for the sake of truth, to interweave
in the plot, while it was necessary to indicate at least their existence.&nbsp;
I have, therefore, put such of them as seemed least absurd into the
mouth of Conrad, to whom, in fact, they owe their original publication,
and have done so, as I hope, not without a just ethical purpose.</p>
<p>Such was my idea: of the inconsistencies and short-comings of this
its realisation, no one can ever be so painfully sensible as I am already
myself.&nbsp; If, however, this book shall cause one Englishman honestly
to ask himself, &lsquo;I, as a Protestant, have been accustomed to assert
the purity and dignity of the offices of husband, wife, and parent.&nbsp;
Have I ever examined the grounds of my own assertion?&nbsp; Do I believe
them to be as callings from God, spiritual, sacramental, divine, eternal?&nbsp;
Or am I at heart regarding and using them, like the Papist, merely as
heaven&rsquo;s indulgences to the infirmities of fallen man?&rsquo;&mdash;then
will my book have done its work.</p>
<p>If, again, it shall deter one young man from the example of those
miserable dilettanti, who in books and sermons are whimpering meagre
second-hand praises of celibacy&mdash;depreciating as carnal and degrading
those family ties to which they owe their own existence, and in the
enjoyment of which they themselves all the while unblushingly indulge&mdash;insulting
thus their own wives and mothers&mdash;nibbling ignorantly at the very
root of that household purity which constitutes the distinctive superiority
of Protestant over Popish nations&mdash;again my book will have done
its work.</p>
<p>If, lastly, it shall awaken one pious Protestant to recognise, in
some, at least, of the Saints of the Middle Age, beings not only of
the same passions, but of the same Lord, the same faith, the same baptism,
as themselves, <i>Protestants</i>, not the less deep and true, because
utterly unconscious and practical&mdash;mighty witnesses against the
two antichrists of their age&mdash;the tyranny of feudal caste, and
the phantoms which Popery substitutes for the living Christ&mdash;then
also will my little book indeed have done its work.&nbsp; C. K.</p>

and died for God, and not for gold;<br />Let their love, their faith,
their boyish daring,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance-mellowed, gild
the days of old.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Tell us how the sexless workers, thronging,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel-tended,
round the convent doors,<br />Wrought to Christian faith and holy order<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savage
hearts alike and barren moors.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Ye who built the churches where we worship,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye
who framed the laws by which we move,<br />Fathers, long belied, and
long forsaken,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! forgive the children of your
love!</p>
<p>(PROMETHEUS)</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Speak! but ask us not to be as ye were!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
but God is changing day by day.<br />He who breathes on man the plastic
spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bids us mould ourselves its robe of clay.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Old anarchic floods of revolution,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowning
ill and good alike in night,<br />Sink, and bare the wrecks of ancient
labour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fossil-teeming, to the searching light.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>There will we find laws, which shall interpret,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
the simpler past, existing life;<br />Delving up from mines and fairy
caverns<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charmed blades, to cut the age&rsquo;s
strife.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>What though fogs may stream from draining waters?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will till the clays to mellow loam;<br />Wake the graveyard of our fathers&rsquo;
spirits;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothe its crumbling mounds with blade
and bloom.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Old decays but foster new creations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bones
and ashes feed the golden corn;<br />Fresh elixirs wander every moment,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down
the veins through which the live past feeds its child, the live unborn.</p>

<h3>SCENE I.&nbsp; A.D. 1220</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Doorway of a closed Chapel in the Wartburg.&nbsp; Elizabeth sitting
on the Steps.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Baby Jesus, who dost lie<br />Far above that stormy
sky,<br />In Thy mother&rsquo;s pure caress,<br />Stoop and save the
motherless.</p>
<p>Happy birds! whom Jesus leaves<br />Underneath His sheltering eaves;<br />There
they go to play and sleep,<br />May not I go in to weep?</p>
<p>All without is mean and small,<br />All within is vast and tall;<br />All
without is harsh and shrill,<br />All within is hushed and still.</p>
<p>Jesus, let me enter in,<br />Wrap me safe from noise and sin.<br />Let
me list the angels&rsquo; songs,<br />See the picture of Thy wrongs;</p>
<p>Let me kiss Thy wounded feet,<br />Drink Thine incense, faint and
sweet,<br />While the clear bells call Thee down<br />From Thine everlasting
throne.</p>
<p>At thy door-step low I bend,<br />Who have neither kin nor friend;<br />Let
me here a shelter find,<br />Shield the shorn lamb from the wind.</p>
<p>Jesu, Lord, my heart will break:<br />Save me for Thy great love&rsquo;s
sake!</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> Isentrudis.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; I had missed my little bird from the
nest,<br />And judged that she was here.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this? fie,
tears?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Go! you despise me like the rest.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Despise you?<br />What&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; King
Andrew&rsquo;s child?&nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s sworn maid?<br />Who dares
despise you?&nbsp; Out upon these Saxons!<br />They sang another note
when I was younger,<br />When from the rich East came my queenly pearl,<br />Lapt
on this fluttering heart, while mighty heroes<br />Rode by her side,
and far behind us stretched<br />The barbs and sumpter mules, a royal
train,<br />Laden with silks and furs, and priceless gems,<br />Wedges
of gold, and furniture of silver,<br />Fit for my princess.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Hush now, I&rsquo;ve heard all, nurse,<br />A
thousand times.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Oh, how their hungry mouths<br />Did water at
the booty!&nbsp; Such a prize,<br />Since the three Kings came wandering
into C&ouml;ln,<br />They ne&rsquo;er saw, nor their fathers;&mdash;well
they knew it!<br />Oh, how they fawned on us!&nbsp; &lsquo;Great Isentrudis!&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Sweet
babe!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Landgravine did thank her saints<br />As if you,
or your silks, had fallen from heaven;<br />And now she wears your furs,
and calls us gipsies.<br />Come tell your nurse your griefs; we&rsquo;ll
weep together,<br />Strangers in this strange land.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I am most friendless.<br />The Landgravine and
Agnes&mdash;you may see them<br />Begrudge the food I eat, and call
me friend<br />Of knaves and serving-maids; the burly knights<br />Freeze
me with cold blue eyes: no saucy page<br />But points and whispers,
&lsquo;There goes our pet nun;<br />Would but her saintship leave her
gold behind,<br />We&rsquo;d give herself her furlough.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Save me! save me!<br />All here are ghastly dreams; dead masks of stone,<br />And
you and I, and Guta, only live:<br />Your eyes alone have souls.&nbsp;
I shall go mad!<br />Oh that they would but leave me all alone<br />To
teach poor girls, and work within my chamber,<br />With mine own thoughts,
and all the gentle angels<br />Which glance about my dreams at morning-tide!<br />Then
I should be as happy as the birds<br />Which sing at my bower window.&nbsp;
Once I longed<br />To be beloved,&mdash;now would they but forget me!<br />Most
vile I must be, or they could not hate me!</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; They are of this world, thou art not, poor child,<br />Therefore
they hate thee, as they did thy betters.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; But, Lewis, nurse?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; He, child? he is thy knight;<br />Espoused from
childhood: thou hast a claim upon him.<br />One that thou&rsquo;lt need,
alas!&mdash;though, I remember&mdash;<br />&rsquo;Tis fifteen years
agone&mdash;when in one cradle<br />We laid two fair babes for a marriage
token;<br />And when your lips met, then you smiled, and twined<br />Your
little limbs together.&mdash;Pray the Saints<br />That token stand!&mdash;He
calls thee love and sister,<br />And brings thee gew-gaws from the wars:
that&rsquo;s much!<br />At least he&rsquo;s thine if thou love him.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; If I love him?<br />What is this love?&nbsp; Why,
is he not my brother<br />And I his sister?&nbsp; Till these weary wars,<br />The
one of us without the other never<br />Did weep or laugh: what is&rsquo;t
should change us now?<br />You shake your head and smile.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Go to; the chafe<br />Comes not by wearing chains,
but feeling them.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Alas! here comes a knight across the court;<br />Oh,
hide me, nurse!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here? this door is fast.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis a friend: he brought my princess
hither,<br />Walter of Varila; I feared him once&mdash;<br />He used
to mock our state, and say, good wine<br />Should want no bush, and
that the cage was gay,<br />But that the bird must sing before he praised
it.<br />Yet he&rsquo;s a kind heart, while his bitter tongue<br />Awes
these court popinjays at times to manners.<br />He will smile sadly
too, when he meets my maiden;<br />And once he said, he was your liegeman
sworn,<br />Since my lost mistress, weeping, to his charge<br />Trusted
the babe she saw no more.&mdash;God help us!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; How did my mother die, nurse?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; She died, my child.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; Why turn away?<br />Too long I&rsquo;ve
guessed at some dread mystery<br />I may not hear: and in my restless
dreams,<br />Night after night, sweeps by a frantic rout<br />Of grinning
fiends, fierce horses, bodiless hands,<br />Which clutch at one to whom
my spirit yearns<br />As to a mother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some fearful
tie<br />Between me and that spirit-world, which God<br />Brands with
his terrors on my troubled mind.<br />Speak! tell me, nurse! is she
in heaven or hell?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; God knows, my child: there are masses for her
soul<br />Each day in every Zingar minster sung.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; But was she holy?&mdash;Died she in the Lord?<br /><i>Isen</i>
[weeps].&nbsp; O God! my child!&nbsp; And if I told thee all,<br />How
couldst thou mend it?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Mend it?&nbsp; O my Saviour!<br />I&rsquo;d die
a saint!<br />Win heaven for her by prayers, and build great minsters,<br />Chantries,
and hospitals for her; wipe out<br />By mighty deeds our race&rsquo;s
guilt and shame&mdash;<br />But thus, poor witless orphan!&nbsp; [Weeps.]</p>
<p>[Count Walter enters.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ah! my princess! accept your liegeman&rsquo;s knee;<br />Down,
down, rheumatic flesh!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Count Walter! you are too tall to kneel
to little girls.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; What? shall two hundredweight of hypocrisy bow
down to his four-inch wooden saint, and the same weight of honesty not
worship his four-foot live one?&nbsp; And I have a jest for you, shall
make my small queen merry and wise.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; You shall jest long before she&rsquo;s merry.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ah! dowers and dowagers again!&nbsp; The money&mdash;root
of all evil.<br />What comes here?&nbsp; [A Page enters.]<br />A long-winged
grasshopper, all gold, green, and gauze?&nbsp; How these young pea-chicks
must needs ape the grown peacock&rsquo;s frippery!&nbsp; Prithee, now,
how many such butterflies as you suck here together on the thistle-head
of royalty?</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Some twelve gentlemen of us, Sir&mdash;apostles
of the blind archer, Love&mdash;owning no divinity but almighty beauty&mdash;no
faith, no hope, no charity, but those which are kindled at her eyes.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Saints! what&rsquo;s all this?</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Ah, Sir! none but countrymen swear by the saints
nowadays: no oaths but allegorical ones, Sir, at the high table; as
thus,&mdash;&lsquo;By the sleeve of beauty, Madam;&rsquo; or again,
&lsquo;By Love his martyrdoms, Sir Count;&rsquo; or to a potentate,
&lsquo;As Jove&rsquo;s imperial mercy shall hear my vows, High Mightiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Where did the evil one set you on finding all this
heathenry?</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Oh, we are all barristers of Love&rsquo;s court,
Sir; we have Ovid&rsquo;s gay science conned, Sir, <i>ad</i> <i>unguentum</i>,
as they say, out of the French book.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; So?&nbsp; There are those come from Rome then will
whip you and Ovid out with the same rod which the dandies of Provence
felt lately to their sorrow.&nbsp; Oh, what blinkards are we gentlemen,
to train any dumb beasts more carefully than we do Christians! that
a man shall keep his dog-breakers, and his horse-breakers, and his hawk-breakers,
and never hire him a boy-breaker or two! that we should live without
a qualm at dangling such a flock of mimicking parroquets at our heels
a while, and then, when they are well infected, well perfumed with the
wind of our vices, dropping them off, as tadpoles do their tails, joint
by joint into the mud! to strain at such gnats as an ill-mouthed colt
or a riotous puppy, and swallow that camel of camels, a page!</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Do you call me a camel, Sir?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your business?</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; My errand is to the Princess here.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; To me?</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Yes; the Landgravine expects you at high mass;
so go in, and mind you clean yourself; for every one is not as fond
as you of beggars&rsquo; brats, and what their clothes leave behind
them.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i> [strikes him].&nbsp; Monkey!&nbsp; To whom are you speaking?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, peace, peace, peace!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go with
him.</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; Then be quick, my music-master&rsquo;s waiting.&nbsp;
Corpo di Bacco! as if our elders did not teach us to whom we ought to
be rude!&nbsp; [Ex. Eliz. and Page.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; See here, Sir Saxon, how this pearl of price<br />Is
faring in your hands!&nbsp; The peerless image,<br />To whom this court
is but the tawdry frame,&mdash;<br />The speck of light amid its murky
baseness,&mdash;<br />The salt which keeps it all from rotting,&mdash;cast<br />To
be the common fool,&mdash;the laughing stock<br />For every beardless
knave to whet his wit on!<br />Tar-blooded Germans!&mdash;Here&rsquo;s
another of them.</p>
<p>[A young Knight enters.]</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Heigh!&nbsp; Count!&nbsp; What? learning to
sing psalms?&nbsp; They are waiting<br />For you in the manage-school,
to give your judgment<br />On that new Norman mare.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Tell them I&rsquo;m busy.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Busy?&nbsp; St. Martin!&nbsp; Knitting stockings,
eh?<br />To clothe the poor withal?&nbsp; Is that your business?<br />I
passed that canting baby on the stairs;<br />Would heaven that she had
tripped, and broke her goose-neck,<br />And left us heirs <i>de</i>
<i>facto</i>.&nbsp; So, farewell.&nbsp; [Exit.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; A very pretty quarrel! matter enough<br />To spoil
a waggon-load of ash-staves on,<br />And break a dozen fools&rsquo;
backs across their cantlets.<br />What&rsquo;s Lewis doing?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Oh&mdash;befooled,&mdash;<br />Bewitched with
dogs and horses, like an idiot<br />Clutching his bauble, while a priceless
jewel<br />Sticks at his miry heels.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s no fool,&mdash;<br />As good a
heart as hers, but somewhat given<br />To hunt the nearest butterfly,
and light<br />The fire of fancy without hanging o&rsquo;er it<br />The
porridge-pot of practice.&nbsp; He shall hear or&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; And quickly, for there&rsquo;s treason in the
wind.<br />They&rsquo;ll keep her dower, and send her home with shame<br />Before
the year&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Humph!&nbsp; Some are rogues enough for&rsquo;t.<br />As
it falls out, I ride with him to-day.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Upon what business?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Some shaveling has been telling him that there
are heretics on his land: Stadings, worshippers of black cats, baby-eaters,
and such like.&nbsp; He consulted me; I told him it would be time enough
to see to the heretics when all the good Christians had been well looked
after.&nbsp; I suppose the novelty of the thing smit him, for now nothing
will serve but I must ride with him round half a dozen hamlets, where,
with God&rsquo;s help, I will show him a mansty or two, that shall astonish
his delicate chivalry.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Oh, here&rsquo;s your time!&nbsp; Speak to him,
noble Walter.<br />Stun his dull ears with praises of her grace;<br />Prick
his dull heart with shame at his own coldness.<br />Oh right us, Count.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; I will, I will: go in<br />And dry your eyes.&nbsp;
[Exeunt separately.]</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Landscape in Thuringia.&nbsp; Lewis and Walter riding.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; So all these lands are mine; these yellow meads&mdash;<br />These
village greens, and forest-fretted hills,<br />With dizzy castles crowned.&nbsp;
Mine!&nbsp; Why that word<br />Is rich in promise, in the action bankrupt.<br />What
faculty of mine, save dream-fed pride,<br />Can these things fatten?&nbsp;
Mass!&nbsp; I had forgot:<br />I have a right to bark at trespassers.<br />Rare
privilege!&nbsp; While every fowl and bush,<br />According to its destiny
and nature<br />(Which were they truly mine, my power could alter),<br />Will
live, and grow, and take no thought of me.<br />Those firs, before whose
stealthy-marching ranks<br />The world-old oaks still dwindle and retreat,<br />If
I could stay their poisoned frown, which cows<br />The pale shrunk underwood,
and nestled seeds<br />Into an age of sleep, &rsquo;twere something:
and those men<br />O&rsquo;er whom that one word &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;
uprears me&mdash;<br />If I could make them lift a finger up<br />But
of their own free will, I&rsquo;d own my seizin.<br />But now&mdash;when
if I sold them, life and limb,<br />There&rsquo;s not a sow would litter
one pig less<br />Than when men called her mine.&mdash;Possession&rsquo;s
naught;<br />A parchment ghost; a word I am ashamed<br />To claim even
here, lest all the forest spirits,<br />And bees who drain unasked the
free-born flowers,<br />Should mock, and cry, &lsquo;Vain man, not thine,
but ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Possession&rsquo;s naught?&nbsp; Possession&rsquo;s
beef and ale&mdash;<br />Soft bed, fair wife, gay horse, good steel.&mdash;Are
they naught?<br />Possession means to sit astride of the world,<br />Instead
of having it astride of you;<br />Is that naught?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the
easiest trade of all too;<br />For he that&rsquo;s fit for nothing else,
is fit<br />To own good land, and on the slowest dolt<br />His state
sits easiest, while his serfs thrive best.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; How now?&nbsp; What need then of long discipline,<br />Not
to mere feats of arms, but feats of soul;<br />To courtesies and high
self-sacrifice,<br />To order and obedience, and the grace<br />Which
makes commands, requests, and service, favour?<br />To faith and prayer,
and pure thoughts, ever turned<br />To that Valhalla, where the virgin
saints<br />And stainless heroes tend the Queen of heaven?<br />Why
these, if I but need, like stalled ox<br />To chew the grass cut for
me?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because<br />I have trained thee for
a knight, boy, not a ruler.<br />All callings want their proper &rsquo;prentice
time<br />But this of ruling; it comes by mother-wit;<br />And if the
wit be not exceeding great,<br />&rsquo;Tis best the wit be most exceeding
small;<br />And he that holds the reins should let the horse<br />Range
on, feed where he will, live and let live.<br />Custom and selfishness
will keep all steady<br />For half a life.&mdash;Six months before you
die<br />You may begin to think of interfering.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Alas! while each day blackens with fresh clouds,<br />Complaints
of ague, fever, crumbling huts,<br />Of land thrown out to the forest,
game and keepers,<br />Bailiffs and barons, plundering all alike;<br />Need,
greed, stupidity: To clear such ruin<br />Would task the rich prime
of some noble hero&mdash;<br />But can I nothing do?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Oh! plenty, Sir;<br />Which no man yet has done
or e&rsquo;er will do.<br />It rests with you, whether the priest be
honoured;<br />It rests with you, whether the knight be knightly;<br />It
rests with you, whether those fields grow corn;<br />It rests with you,
whether those toiling peasants<br />Lift to their masters free and loyal
eyes,<br />Or crawl, like jaded hacks, to welcome graves.<br />It rests
with you&mdash;and will rest.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll crowd my court and dais with men of
God,<br />As doth my peerless namesake, King of France.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Priests, Sir?&nbsp; The Frenchman keeps two counsellors<br />Worth
any drove of priests.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; And who are they?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; God and his lady-love, [aside]&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
open at that&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I could be that man&rsquo;s squire.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i> [aside]&nbsp; Again run riot&mdash;<br />Now for another
cast, [aloud]&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d sleep sound, Sir,<br />You&rsquo;ll
let priests pray for you, but school you never.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Mass! who more fitted?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; None, if you could trust them;<br />But they are
the people&rsquo;s creatures; poor men give them<br />Their power at
the church, and take it back at the ale-house:<br />Then what&rsquo;s
the friar to the starving peasant?<br />Just what the abbot is to the
greedy noble&mdash;<br />A scarecrow to lear wolves.&nbsp; Go ask the
church plate,<br />Safe in knights&rsquo; cellars, how these priests
are feared.<br />Bruised reeds when you most need them.&mdash;No, my
Lord;<br />Copy them, trust them never.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Copy? wherein?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; In letting every man<br />Do what he likes, and
only seeing he does it<br />As you do your work&mdash;well.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the Church secret<br />For breeding towns, as fast as you breed roe-deer;<br />Example,
but not meddling.&nbsp; See that hollow&mdash;<br />I knew it once all
heath, and deep peat-bog&mdash;<br />I drowned a black mare in that
self-same spot<br />Hunting with your good father: Well, he gave<br />One
jovial night, to six poor Erfurt monks&mdash;<br />Six picked-visaged,
wan, bird-fingered wights&mdash;<br />All in their rough hair shirts,
like hedgehogs starved&mdash;<br />I told them, six weeks&rsquo; work
would break their hearts:<br />They answered, Christ would help, and
Christ&rsquo;s great mother,<br />And make them strong when weakest:
So they settled:<br />And starved and froze.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; And dug and built, it seems.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Faith, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; See&mdash;as garden
walls draw snails,<br />They have drawn a hamlet round; the slopes are
blue,<br />Knee-deep with flax, the orchard boughs are breaking<br />With
strange outlandish fruits.&nbsp; See those young rogues<br />Marching
to school; no poachers here, Lord Landgrave,&mdash;<br />Too much to
be done at home; there&rsquo;s not a village<br />Of yours, now, thrives
like this.&nbsp; By God&rsquo;s good help<br />These men have made their
ownership worth something.<br />Here comes one of them.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I would speak to him&mdash;<br />And learn his
secret.&mdash;We&rsquo;ll await him here.</p>
<p>[Enter Conrad.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Peace to you, reverend and war-worn knight,<br />And
you, fair youth, upon whose swarthy lip<br />Blooms the rich promise
of a noble manhood.<br />Methinks, if simple monks may read your thoughts,<br />That
with no envious or distasteful eyes<br />Ye watch the labours of God&rsquo;s
poor elect.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why&mdash;we were saying, how you cunning rooks<br />Pitch
as by instinct on the fattest fallows.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; For He who feeds the ravens, promiseth<br />Our
bread and water sure, and leads us on<br />By peaceful streams in pastures
green to lie,<br />Beneath our Shepherd&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; In such a nook, now,<br />To nestle from this
noisy world&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; And drop<br />The burden of thyself upon the threshold.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Think what rich dreams may haunt those lowly
roofs!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Rich dreams,&mdash;and more; their dreams will
find fulfilment&mdash;<br />Their discipline breeds strength&mdash;&rsquo;Tis
we alone<br />Can join the patience of the labouring ox<br />Unto the
eagle&rsquo;s foresight,&mdash;not a fancy<br />Of ours, but grows in
time to mighty deeds;<br />Victories in heavenly warfare: but yours,
yours, Sir,<br />Oh, choke them, choke the panting hopes of youth,<br />Ere
they be born, and wither in slow pains,<br />Cast by for the next bauble!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too true!<br />I dread no toil; toil
is the true knight&rsquo;s pastime&mdash;<br />Faith fails, the will
intense and fixed, so easy<br />To thee, cut off from life and love,
whose powers<br />In one close channel must condense their stream:<br />But
I, to whom this life blooms rich and busy,<br />Whose heart goes out
a-Maying all the year<br />In this new Eden&mdash;in my fitful thought<br />What
skill is there, to turn my faith to sight&mdash;<br />To pierce blank
Heaven, like some trained falconer<br />After his game, beyond all human
ken?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; And walk into the bog beneath your feet.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; And change it to firm land by magic step!<br />Build
there cloud-cleaving spires, beneath whose shade<br />Great cities rise
for vassals; to call forth<br />From plough and loom the rank unlettered
hinds,<br />And make them saints and heroes&mdash;send them forth<br />To
sway with heavenly craft the spirit of princes;<br />Change nations&rsquo;
destinies, and conquer worlds<br />With love, more mighty than the sword;
what, Count?<br />Art thou ambitious? practical? we monks<br />Can teach
you somewhat there too.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Be it so;<br />But love you have forsworn; and
what were life<br />Without that chivalry, which bends man&rsquo;s knees<br />Before
God&rsquo;s image and his glory, best<br />Revealed in woman&rsquo;s
beauty?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Ah! poor worldlings!<br />Little you dream what
maddening ecstasies,<br />What rich ideals haunt, by day and night,<br />Alone,
and in the crowd, even to the death,<br />The servitors of that celestial
court<br />Where peerless Mary, sun-enthroned, reigns,<br />In whom
all Eden dreams of womanhood,<br />All grace of form, hue, sound, all
beauty strewn<br />Like pearls unstrung, about this ruined world,<br />Have
their fulfilment and their archetype.<br />Why hath the rose its scent,
the lily grace?<br />To mirror forth her loveliness, from whom,<br />Primeval
fount of grace, their livery came:<br />Pattern of Seraphs! only worthy
ark<br />To bear her God athwart the floods of time!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Who dare aspire to her?&nbsp; Alas, not I!<br />To
me she is a doctrine, and a picture:&mdash;<br />I cannot live on dreams.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; She hath her train:&mdash;<br />There thou may&rsquo;st
choose thy love: If world-wide lore<br />Shall please thee, and the
Cherub&rsquo;s glance of fire,<br />Let Catharine lift thy soul, and
rapt with her<br />Question the mighty dead, until thou float<br />Tranced
on the ethereal ocean of her spirit.<br />If pity father passion in
thee, hang<br />Above Eulalia&rsquo;s tortured loveliness;<br />And
for her sake, and in her strength, go forth<br />To do and suffer greatly.&nbsp;
Dost thou long<br />For some rich heart, as deep in love as weakness,<br />Whose
wild simplicity sweet heaven-born instincts<br />Alone keep sane?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I do, I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d live<br />And die
for each and all the three.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Then go&mdash;<br />Entangled in the Magdalen&rsquo;s
tresses lie;<br />Dream hours before her picture, till thy lips<br />Dare
to approach her feet, and thou shalt start<br />To find the canvas warm
with life, and matter<br />A moment transubstantiate to heaven.</p>
<p>Wal.&nbsp; Ay, catch his fever, Sir, and learn to take<br />An indigestion
for a troop of angels.<br />Come, tell him, monk, about your magic gardens,<br />Where
not a stringy head of kale is cut<br />But breeds a vision or a revelation.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Hush, hush, Count!&nbsp; Speak, strange monk,
strange words, and waken<br />Longings more strange than either.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Then, if proved,<br />As I dare vouch thee, loyal
in thy love,<br />Even to the Queen herself thy saintlier soul<br />At
length may soar: perchance&mdash;Oh, bliss too great<br />For thought&mdash;yet
possible!<br />Receive some token&mdash;smile&mdash;or hallowing touch<br />Of
that white hand, beneath whose soft caress<br />The raging world is
smoothed, and runs its course<br />To shadow forth her glory.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Thou dost tempt me&mdash;<br />That were a knightly
quest.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Ay, here&rsquo;s true love.<br />Love&rsquo;s heaven,
without its hell; the golden fruit<br />Without the foul husk, which
at Adam&rsquo;s fall<br />Did crust it o&rsquo;er with filth and selfishness.<br />I
tempt thee heavenward&mdash;from yon azure walls<br />Unearthly beauties
beckon&mdash;God&rsquo;s own mother<br />Waits longing for thy choice&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Is this a dream?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ay, by the Living Lord, who died for you!<br />Will
you be cozened, Sir, by these air-blown fancies,<br />These male hysterics,
by starvation bred<br />And huge conceit?&nbsp; Cast off God&rsquo;s
gift of manhood,<br />And, like the dog in the adage, drop the true
bone<br />With snapping at the sham one in the water?<br />What were
you born a man for?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ay, I know it:&mdash;<br />I cannot live on dreams.&nbsp;
Oh for one friend,<br />Myself, yet not myself; one not so high<br />But
she could love me, not too pure to pardon<br />My sloth and meanness!&nbsp;
Oh for flesh and blood,<br />Before whose feet I could adore, yet love!<br />How
easy then were duty!&nbsp; From her lips<br />To learn my daily task;&mdash;in
her pure eyes<br />To see the living type of those heaven-glories<br />I
dare not look on;&mdash;let her work her will<br />Of love and wisdom
on these straining hinds;&mdash;<br />To squire a saint around her labour
field,<br />And she and it both mine:&mdash;That were possession!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The flesh, fair youth&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Avaunt, bald snake, avaunt!<br />We are past your
burrow now.&nbsp; Come, come, Lord Landgrave,<br />Look round, and find
your saint.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Alas! one such&mdash;<br />One such, I know,
who upward from one cradle<br />Beside me like a sister&mdash;No, thank
God! no sister!&mdash;<br />Has grown and grown, and with her mellow
shade<br />Has blanched my thornless thoughts to her own hue,<br />And
even now is budding into blossom,<br />Which never shall bear fruit,
but inward still<br />Resorb its vital nectar, self-contained,<br />And
leave no living copies of its beauty<br />To after ages.&nbsp; Ah! be
less, sweet maid,<br />Less than thyself!&nbsp; Yet no&mdash;my wife
thou might&rsquo;st be,<br />If less than thus&mdash;but not the saint
thou art.<br />What! shall my selfish longings drag thee down<br />From
maid to wife? degrade the soul I worship?<br />That were a caitiff deed!&nbsp;
Oh, misery!<br />Is wedlock treason to that purity,<br />Which is the
jewel and the soul of wedlock?<br />Elizabeth! my saint!&nbsp; [Exit
Conrad.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; What, Sir? the Princess?<br />Ye saints in heaven,
I thank you!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Oh, who else,<br />Who else the minutest lineament
fulfils<br />Of this my cherished portrait?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; So&mdash;&rsquo;tis well.<br />Hear me, my Lord.&mdash;You
think this dainty princess<br />Too perfect for you, eh?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
well again;<br />For that whose price after fruition falls<br />May
well too high be rated ere enjoyed&mdash;<br />In plain words,&mdash;if
she looks an angel now, you will be better mated than you expected,
when you find her&mdash;a woman.&nbsp; For flesh and blood she is, and
that young blood,&mdash;whom her childish misusage and your brotherly
love; her loneliness and your protection; her springing fancy and (for
I may speak to you as a son) your beauty and knightly grace, have so
bewitched, and as some say, degraded, that briefly, she loves you, and
briefly, better, her few friends fear, than you love her.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Loves me!&nbsp; My Count, that word is quickly
spoken;<br />And yet, if it be true, it thrusts me forth<br />Upon a
shoreless sea of untried passion,<br />From whence is no return.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; By Siegfried&rsquo;s sword,<br />My words are true,
and I came here to say them,<br />To thee, my son in all but blood.<br />Mass,
I&rsquo;m no gossip.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What ails the boy?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Loves me!&nbsp; Henceforth let no man, peering
down<br />Through the dim glittering mine of future years,<br />Say
to himself &lsquo;Too much! this cannot be!&rsquo;<br />To-day, and
custom, wall up our horizon:<br />Before the hourly miracle of life<br />Blindfold
we stand, and sigh, as though God were not.<br />I have wandered in
the mountains, mist-bewildered,<br />And now a breeze comes, and the
veil is lifted,<br />And priceless flowers, o&rsquo;er which I trod
unheeding,<br />Gleam ready for my grasp.&nbsp; She loves me then!<br />She
who to me was as a nightingale<br />That sings in magic gardens, rock-beleaguered,<br />To
passing angels melancholy music&mdash;<br />Whose dark eyes hung, like
far-off evening stars,<br />Through rosy-cushioned windows coldly shining<br />Down
from the cloud-world of her unknown fancy&mdash;<br />She, for whom
holiest touch of holiest knight<br />Seemed all too gross&mdash;who
might have been a saint<br />And companied with angels&mdash;thus to
pluck<br />The spotless rose of her own maidenhood<br />To give it unto
me!</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; You love her then?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Look! if yon solid mountain were all gold,<br />And
each particular tree a band of jewels,<br />And from its womb the Niebelungen
hoard<br />With elfin wardens called me, &lsquo;Leave thy love<br />And
be our Master&rsquo;&mdash;I would turn away&mdash;<br />And know no
wealth but her.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Shall I say this to her?<br />I am no carrier pigeon,
Sir, by breed,<br />But now, between her friends and persecutors,<br />My
life&rsquo;s a burden.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Persecutors!&nbsp; Who?<br />Alas!&nbsp; I guess
it&mdash;I had known my mother<br />Too light for that fair saint,&mdash;but
who else dare wink<br />When she is by?&nbsp; My knights?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; To a man, my Lord.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s chivalry!&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s
soon brought to bar.<br />The quarrel&rsquo;s mine; my lance shall clear
that stain.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Quarrel with your knights?&nbsp; Cut your own chair-legs
off!<br />They do but sail with the stream.&nbsp; Her passion, Sir,<br />Broke
shell and ran out twittering before yours did,<br />And unrequited love
is mortal sin<br />With this chaste world.&nbsp; My boy, my boy, I tell
you,<br />The fault lies nearer home.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I have played the coward&mdash;<br />And in the
sloth of false humility,<br />Cast by the pearl I dared not to deserve.<br />How
laggard I must seem to her, though she love me;<br />Playing with hawks
and hounds, while she sits weeping!<br />&rsquo;Tis not too late.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Too late, my royal eyas?<br />You shall strike
this deer yourself at gaze ere long&mdash;<br />She has no mind to slip
to cover.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Come&mdash;<br />We&rsquo;ll back&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
back; and you shall bear the message;<br />I am ashamed to speak.&nbsp;
Tell her I love her&mdash;<br />That I should need to tell her!&nbsp;
Say, my coyness<br />Was bred of worship, not of coldness.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Then the serfs<br />Must wait?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; This day to them, too, blessing
brings,<br />Which clears from envious webs their guardian angel&rsquo;s
wings.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>

<h3>SCENE III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>A</i> <i>Chamber</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Castle</i>.&nbsp;
Sophia, Elizabeth, Agnes, Isentrude, etc., <i>re-entering.</i></p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; What! you will not?&nbsp; You hear, Dame Isentrude,<br />She
will not wear her coronet in the church,<br />Because, forsooth, the
crucifix within<br />Is crowned with thorns.&nbsp; You hear her.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Noble mother!<br />How could I flaunt this bauble
in His face<br />Who hung there, naked, bleeding, all for me&mdash;<br />I
felt it shamelessness to go so gay.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Felt?&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Every foolish wench
has feelings<br />In these religious days, and thinks it carnal<br />To
wash her dishes, and obey her parents&mdash;<br />No wonder they ape
you, if you ape them&mdash;<br />Go to!&nbsp; I hate this humble-minded
pride,<br />Self-willed submission&mdash;to your own pert fancies;<br />This
fog-bred mushroom-spawn of brain-sick wits,<br />Who make their oddities
their test for grace,<br />And peer about to catch the general eye;<br />Ah!&nbsp;
I have watched you throw your playmates down<br />To have the pleasure
of kneeling for their pardon.<br />Here&rsquo;s sanctity&mdash;to shame
your cousin and me&mdash;<br />Spurn rank and proper pride, and decency;&mdash;<br />If
God has made you noble, use your rank,<br />If you but know how.&nbsp;
You Landgravine?&nbsp; You mated<br />With gentle Lewis?&nbsp; Why,
belike you&rsquo;ll cowl him,<br />As that stern prude, your aunt, cowled
her poor spouse;<br />No&mdash;one Hedwiga at a time&rsquo;s enough,&mdash;<br />My
son shall die no monk.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Beseech you, Madam,&mdash;<br />Weep not, my darling.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Tut&mdash;I&rsquo;ll speak my mind.<br />We&rsquo;ll
have no saints.&nbsp; Thank heaven, my saintliness<br />Ne&rsquo;er
troubled my good man, by day or night.<br />We&rsquo;ll have no saints,
I say; far better for you,<br />And no doubt pleasanter&mdash;You know
your place&mdash;<br />At least you know your place,&mdash;to take to
cloisters,<br />And there sit carding wool, and mumbling Latin,<br />With
sour old maids, and maundering Magdalens,<br />Proud of your frost-kibed
feet, and dirty serge.<br />There&rsquo;s nothing noble in you, but
your blood;<br />And that one almost doubts.&nbsp; Who art thou, child?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; The daughter, please your highness,<br />Of Andreas,
King of Hungary, your better;<br />And your son&rsquo;s spouse.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; I had forgotten, truly&mdash;<br />And you, Dame
Isentrudis, are her servant,<br />And mine: come, Agnes, leave the gipsy
ladies<br />To say their prayers, and set the Saints the fashion.</p>
<p>[Sophia and Agnes go out.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Proud hussy!&nbsp; Thou shalt set thy foot on
her neck yet, darling,<br />When thou art Landgravine.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; And when will that be?<br />No, she speaks truth!&nbsp;
I should have been a nun.<br />These are the wages of my cowardice,&mdash;<br />Too
weak to face the world, too weak to leave it!</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the veil with you.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere but a moment&rsquo;s work,&mdash;<br />To
slip into the convent there below,<br />And be at peace for ever.&nbsp;
And you, my nurse?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; I will go with thee, child, where&rsquo;er thou
goest.<br />But Lewis?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah! my brother!&nbsp; No, I dare not&mdash;<br />I
dare not turn for ever from this hope,<br />Though it be dwindled to
a thread of mist.<br />Oh that we two could flee and leave this Babel!<br />Oh
if he were but some poor chapel-priest,<br />In lonely mountain valleys
far away;<br />And I his serving-maid, to work his vestments,<br />And
dress his scrap of food, and see him stand<br />Before the altar like
a rainbowed saint;<br />To take the blessed wafer from his hand,<br />Confess
my heart to him, and all night long<br />Pray for him while he slept,
or through the lattice<br />Watch while he read, and see the holy thoughts<br />Swell
in his big deep eyes!&mdash;Alas! that dream<br />Is wilder than the
one that&rsquo;s fading even now!<br />Who&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; [A Page
enters.]</p>
<p><i>Page</i>.&nbsp; The Count of Varila, Madam, begs permission to
speak with you.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; With me?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this new terror?<br />Tell
him I wait him.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i> [aside].&nbsp; Ah! my old heart sinks&mdash;<br />God
send us rescue!&nbsp; Here the champion comes.</p>
<p>[Count Walter enters.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Most learned, fair, and sanctimonious Princess&mdash;<br />Plague,
what comes next?&nbsp; I had something orthodox ready;<br />&rsquo;Tis
dropped out by the way.&mdash;Mass! here&rsquo;s the pith on&rsquo;t.&mdash;<br />Madam,
I come a-wooing; and for one<br />Who is as only worthy of your love,<br />As
you of his; he bids me claim the spousals<br />Made long ago between
you,&mdash;and yet leaves<br />Your fancy free, to grant or pass that
claim:<br />And being that Mercury is not my planet,<br />He hath advised
himself to set herein,<br />With pen and ink, what seemed good to him,<br />As
passport to this jewelled mirror, pledge<br />Unworthy of his worship.&nbsp;
[Gives a letter and jewel.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Nunc Domine dimittis servam tuam!</p>
<p>[Elizabeth looks over the letter and casket, claps her hands and
bursts into childish laughter.]</p>
<p>Why here&rsquo;s my Christmas tree come after Lent&mdash;<br />Espousals?
pledges? by our childish love?<br />Pretty words for folks to think
of at the wars,&mdash;<br />And pretty presents come of them!&nbsp;
Look, Guta!<br />A crystal clear, and carven on the reverse<br />The
blessed rood.&nbsp; He told me once&mdash;one night,<br />When we did
sit in the garden&mdash;What was I saying?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; My fairest Princess, as ambassador,<br />What shall
I answer?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Tell him&mdash;tell him&mdash;God!<br />Have I
grown mad, or a child, within the moment?<br />The earth has lost her
gray sad hue, and blazes<br />With her old life-light; hark! yon wind&rsquo;s
a song&mdash;<br />Those clouds are angels&rsquo; robes.&mdash;That
fiery west<br />Is paved with smiling faces.&mdash;I am a woman,<br />And
all things bid me love! my dignity<br />Is thus to cast my virgin pride
away;<br />And find my strength in weakness.&mdash;Busy brain!<br />Thou
keep&rsquo;st pace with my heart; old lore, old fancies,<br />Buried
for years, leap from their tombs, and proffer<br />Their magic service
to my new-born spirit.<br />I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;I am not mistress of
myself&mdash;<br />Send for him&mdash;bring him to me&mdash;he is mine!&nbsp;
[Exit.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Ah! blessed Saints! how changed upon the moment!<br />She
is grown taller, trust me, and her eye<br />Flames like a fresh-caught
hind&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She that was christened<br />A brown mouse for her
stillness!&nbsp; Good my Lord!<br />Now shall mine old bones see the
grave in peace!</p>

<h3>SCENE IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Bridal Feast.&nbsp; Elizabeth, Lewis, Sophia, and Company seated
at the Dais table.&nbsp; Court Minstrel and Court Fool sitting on the
Dais steps.</p>
<p><i>Min</i>.&nbsp; How gaily smile the heavens,<br />The light winds
whisper gay;<br />For royal birth and knightly worth<br />Are knit to
one to-day.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i> [drowning his voice]<i>.<br /></i>So we&rsquo;ll flatter
them up, and we&rsquo;ll cocker them up,<br />Till we turn young brains;<br />And
pamper the brach till we make her a wolf,<br />And get bit by the legs
for our pains.</p>
<p><i>Monks</i> [chanting without]<i>.<br /></i>A fastu et superbi&acirc;<br />Domine
libera nos.</p>
<p><i>Min</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath sandal red and samit&eacute;,<br />Are
knights and ladies set;<br />The henchmen tall stride through the hall,<br />The
board with wine is wet.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; Oh! merrily growls the starving hind,<br />At
my full skin;<br />And merrily howl wolf, wind, and owl,<br />While
I lie warm within.</p>
<p><i>Monks</i>.&nbsp; A luxu et avariti&acirc;<br />Domine libera nos.</p>
<p><i>Min</i>.&nbsp; Hark! from the bridal bower,<br />Rings out the
bridesmaid&rsquo;s song;<br />&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the mystic hour of an
untried power,<br />The bride she tarries long.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s schooling herself and she&rsquo;s
steeling herself,<br />Against the dreary day,<br />When she&rsquo;ll
pine and sigh from her lattice high<br />For the knight that&rsquo;s
far away.</p>
<p><i>Monks</i>.&nbsp; A carnis illectamentis<br />Domine libera nos.</p>
<p><i>Min</i>.&nbsp; Blest maid! fresh roses o&rsquo;er thee<br />The
careless years shall fling;<br />While days and nights shall new delights<br />To
sense and fancy bring.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; Satins and silks, and feathers and lace,<br />Will
gild life&rsquo;s pill;<br />In jewels and gold folks cannot grow old,<br />Fine
ladies will never fall ill.</p>
<p><i>Monks</i>.&nbsp; A vanitatibus s&aelig;culi<br />Domine libera
nos.</p>
<p>[Sophia descends from the Dais, leading Elizabeth.&nbsp; Ladies follow.]</p>
<p><i>Sophia</i> [to the Fool].&nbsp; Silence, you screech-owl.&mdash;<br />Come
strew flowers, fair ladies,<br />And lead into her bower our fairest
bride,<br />The cynosure of love and beauty here,<br />Who shrines heaven&rsquo;s
graces in earth&rsquo;s richest casket.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I come, [aside] Here, Guta, take those monks a
fee&mdash;<br />Tell them I thank them&mdash;bid them pray for me.<br />I
am half mazed with trembling joy within,<br />And noisy wassail round.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis well, for else<br />The spectre of my duties and my dangers<br />Would
whelm my heart with terror.&nbsp; Ah! poor self!<br />Thou took&rsquo;st
this for the term and bourne of troubles&mdash;<br />And now &rsquo;tis
here, thou findest it the gate<br />Of new sin-cursed infinities of
labour,<br />Where thou must do, or die!<br />[aloud] Lead on.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll follow.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; There, now.&nbsp; No fee for the fool; and yet
my prescription was as good as those old Jeremies&rsquo;.&nbsp; But
in law, physic, and divinity, folks had sooner be poisoned in Latin,
than saved in the mother-tongue.</p>

<h3>SCENE I.&nbsp; A.D. 1221-27</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Bower.&nbsp; Night.&nbsp; Lewis sleeping in an
Alcove.</p>
<p>Elizabeth lying on the Floor in the Foreground.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; No streak yet in the blank and eyeless east&mdash;<br />More
weary hours to ache, and smart, and shiver<br />On these bare boards,
within a step of bliss.<br />Why peevish?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis mine own
will keeps me here&mdash;<br />And yet I hate myself for that same will:<br />Fightings
within and out!&nbsp; How easy &rsquo;twere, now,<br />Just to be like
the rest, and let life run&mdash;<br />To use up to the rind what joys
God sends us,<br />Not thus forestall His rod: What! and so lose<br />The
strength which comes by suffering?&nbsp; Well, if grief<br />Be gain,
mine&rsquo;s double&mdash;fleeing thus the snare<br />Of yon luxurious
and unnerving down,<br />And widowed from mine Eden.&nbsp; And why widowed?<br />Because
they tell me, love is of the flesh,<br />And that&rsquo;s our house-bred
foe, the adder in our bosoms,<br />Which warmed to life, will sting
us.&nbsp; They must know&mdash;<br />I do confess mine ignorance, O
Lord!<br />Mine earnest will these painful limbs may prove.<br />. .
. . .<br />And yet I swore to love him.&mdash;So I do<br />No more than
I have sworn.&nbsp; Am I to blame<br />If God makes wedlock that, which
if it be not,<br />It were a shame for modest lips to speak it,<br />And
silly doves are better mates than we?<br />And yet our love is Jesus&rsquo;
due,&mdash;and all things<br />Which share with Him divided empery<br />Are
snares and idols&mdash;&lsquo;To love, to cherish, and to obey!&rsquo;<br />.
. . . .<br />O deadly riddle!&nbsp; Rent and twofold life!<br />O cruel
troth!&nbsp; To keep thee or to break thee<br />Alike seems sin!&nbsp;
O thou beloved tempter,</p>
<p>[Turning toward the bed.]</p>
<p>Who first didst teach me love, why on thyself<br />From God divert
thy lesson?&nbsp; Wilt provoke Him?<br />What if mine heavenly Spouse
in jealous ire<br />Should smite mine earthly spouse?&nbsp; Have I two
husbands?<br />The words are horror&mdash;yet they are orthodox!</p>
<p>[Rises and goes to the window.]</p>
<p>How many many brows of happy lovers<br />The fragrant lips of night
even now are kissing!<br />Some wandering hand in hand through arched
lanes;<br />Some listening for loved voices at the lattice;<br />Some
steeped in dainty dreams of untried bliss;<br />Some nestling soft and
deep in well-known arms,<br />Whose touch makes sleep rich life.&nbsp;
The very birds<br />Within their nests are wooing!&nbsp; So much love!<br />All
seek their mates, or finding, rest in peace;<br />The earth seems one
vast bride-bed.&nbsp; Doth God tempt us?<br />Is&rsquo;t all a veil
to blind our eyes from him?<br />A fire-fly at the candle.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
love leads him;<br />Love&rsquo;s light, and light is love: O Eden!&nbsp;
Eden!<br />Eve was a virgin there, they say; God knows.<br />Must all
this be as it had never been?<br />Is it all a fleeting type of higher
love?<br />Why, if the lesson&rsquo;s pure, is not the teacher<br />Pure
also?&nbsp; Is it my shame to feel no shame?<br />Am I more clean, the
more I scent uncleanness?<br />Shall base emotions picture Christ&rsquo;s
embrace?<br />Rest, rest, torn heart!&nbsp; Yet where? in earth or heaven?<br />Still,
from out the bright abysses, gleams our Lady&rsquo;s silver footstool,<br />Still
the light-world sleeps beyond her, though the night-clouds fleet below.<br />Oh
that I were walking, far above, upon that dappled pavement,<br />Heaven&rsquo;s
floor, which is the ceiling of the dungeon where we lie.<br />Ah, what
blessed Saints might meet me, on that platform, sliding silent,<br />Past
us in its airy travels, angel-wafted, mystical!<br />They perhaps might
tell me all things, opening up the secret fountains<br />Which now struggle,
dark and turbid, through their dreary prison clay.<br />Love! art thou
an earth-born streamlet, that thou seek&rsquo;st the lowest hollows?<br />Sure
some vapours float up from thee, mingling with the highest blue.<br />Spirit-love
in spirit-bodies, melted into one existence&mdash;<br />Joining praises
through the ages&mdash;Is it all a minstrel&rsquo;s dream?<br />Alas!
he wakes.&nbsp; [Lewis rises.]</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ah! faithless beauty,<br />Is this your promise,
that whene&rsquo;er you prayed<br />I should be still the partner of
your vigils,<br />And learn from you to pray?&nbsp; Last night I lay
dissembling<br />When she who woke you, took my feet for yours:<br />Now
I shall seize my lawful prize perforce.<br />Alas! what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp;
These shoulders&rsquo; cushioned ice,<br />And thin soft flanks, with
purple lashes all,<br />And weeping furrows traced!&nbsp; Ah! precious
life-blood!<br />Who has done this?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Forgive! &rsquo;twas I&mdash;my maidens&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; O ruthless hags!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Not so, not so&mdash;They wept<br />When I did
bid them, as I bid thee now<br />To think of nought but love.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Elizabeth!<br />Speak!&nbsp; I will know the
meaning of this madness!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Beloved, thou hast heard how godly souls,<br />In
every age, have tamed the rebel flesh<br />By such sharp lessons.&nbsp;
I must tread their paths,<br />If I would climb the mountains where
they rest.<br />Grief is the gate of bliss&mdash;why wedlock&mdash;knighthood&mdash;<br />A
mother&rsquo;s joy&mdash;a hard-earned field of glory&mdash;<br />By
tribulation come&mdash;so doth God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; But doleful nights, and self-inflicted tortures&mdash;<br />Are
these the love of God?&nbsp; Is He well pleased<br />With this stern
holocaust of health and joy?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Am I not as gay a lady-love<br />As
ever clipt in arms a noble knight?<br />Am I not blithe as bird the
live-long day?<br />It pleases me to bear what you call pain,<br />Therefore
to me &rsquo;tis pleasure: joy and grief<br />Are the will&rsquo;s creatures;
martyrs kiss the stake&mdash;<br />The moorland colt enjoys the thorny
furze&mdash;<br />The dullest boor will seek a fight, and count<br />His
pleasure by his wounds; you must forget, love,<br />Eve&rsquo;s curse
lays suffering, as their natural lot,<br />On womankind, till custom
makes it light.<br />I know the use of pain: bar not the leech<br />Because
his cure is bitter&mdash;&rsquo;Tis such medicine<br />Which breeds
that paltry strength, that weak devotion,<br />For which you say you
love me.&mdash;Ay, which brings<br />Even when most sharp, a stern and
awful joy<br />As its attendant angel&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say no more&mdash;<br />Not
even to thee&mdash;command, and I&rsquo;ll obey thee.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Thou casket of all graces! fourfold wonder<br />Of
wit and beauty, love and wisdom!&nbsp; Canst thou<br />Beatify the ascetic&rsquo;s
savagery<br />To heavenly prudence?&nbsp; Horror melts to pity,<br />And
pity kindles to adoring shower<br />Of radiant tears!&nbsp; Thou tender
cruelty!<br />Gay smiling martyrdom!&nbsp; Shall I forbid thee?<br />Limit
thy depth by mine own shallowness?<br />Thy courage by my weakness?&nbsp;
Where thou darest,<br />I&rsquo;ll shudder and submit.&nbsp; I kneel
here spell-bound<br />Before my bleeding Saviour&rsquo;s living likeness<br />To
worship, not to cavil: I had dreamt of such things,<br />Dim heard in
legends, while my pitiful blood<br />Tingled through every vein, and
wept, and swore<br />&rsquo;Twas beautiful, &rsquo;twas Christ-like&mdash;had
I thought<br />That thou wert such:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; You would have loved me still?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I have gone mad, I think, at every parting<br />At
mine own terrors for thee.&nbsp; No; I&rsquo;ll learn to glory<br />In
that which makes thee glorious!&nbsp; Noble stains!<br />I&rsquo;ll
call them rose leaves out of paradise<br />Strewn on the wreathed snows,
or rubies dropped<br />From martyrs&rsquo; diadems, prints of Jesus&rsquo;
cross<br />Too truly borne, alas!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I think, mine own,<br />I am forgiven at last?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; To-night, my sister&mdash;<br />Henceforth I&rsquo;ll
clasp thee to my heart so fast<br />Thou shalt not &rsquo;scape unnoticed.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i> [laughing]&nbsp; We shall see&mdash;<br />Now I must
stop those wise lips with a kiss,<br />And lead thee back to scenes
of simpler bliss.</p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Chamber in the Castle.&nbsp; Elizabeth&mdash;the Fool<br />Isentrudis&mdash;Guta
singing.</p>
<p>High among the lonely hills,<br />While I lay beside my sheep,<br />Rest
came down and filled my soul,<br />From the everlasting deep.</p>
<p>Changeless march the stars above,<br />Changeless morn succeeds to
even;<br />Still the everlasting hills,<br />Changeless watch the changeless
heaven.</p>
<p>See the rivers, how they run,<br />Changeless toward the changeless
sea;<br />All around is forethought sure,<br />Fixed will and stern
decree.</p>
<p>Can the sailor move the main?<br />Will the potter heed the clay?<br />Mortal!
where the spirit drives,<br />Thither must the wheels obey.</p>
<p>Neither ask, nor fret, nor strive:<br />Where thy path is, thou shall
go.<br />He who made the streams of time<br />Wafts thee down to weal
or woe.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a sweet song, and yet it does not
chime<br />With my heart&rsquo;s inner voice.&nbsp; Where had you it,
Guta?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; From a nun who was a shepherdess in her youth&mdash;sadly
plagued she was by a cruel stepmother, till she fled to a convent and
found rest to her soul.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; No doubt; nothing so pleasant as giving up one&rsquo;s
will in one&rsquo;s own way.&nbsp; But she might have learnt all that
without taking cold on the hill-tops.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Where then, Fool?</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; At any market-cross where two or three rogues
are together, who have neither grace to mend, nor courage to say &lsquo;I
did it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now you shall see the shepherdess&rsquo; baby dressed
in my cap and bells.&nbsp; [Sings.]</p>
<p>When I was a greenhorn and young,<br />And wanted to be and to do,<br />I
puzzled my brains about choosing my line,<br />Till I found out the
way that things go.</p>
<p>The same piece of clay makes a tile,<br />A pitcher, a taw, or a
brick:<br />Dan Horace knew life; you may cut out a saint,<br />Or a
bench, from the self-same stick.</p>
<p>The urchin who squalls in a gaol,<br />By circumstance turns out
a rogue;<br />While the castle-bred brat is a senator born,<br />Or
a saint, if religion&rsquo;s in vogue.</p>
<p>We fall on our legs in this world,<br />Blind kittens, tossed in
neck and heels:<br />&rsquo;Tis Dame Circumstance licks Nature&rsquo;s
cubs into shape,<br />She&rsquo;s the mill-head, if we are the wheels.</p>
<p>Then why puzzle and fret, plot and dream?<br />He that&rsquo;s wise
will just follow his nose;<br />Contentedly fish, while he swims with
the stream;<br />&rsquo;Tis no business of his where it goes.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Far too well sung for such a saucy song.<br />So
go.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>.&nbsp; Ay, I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; Whip the dog out of church,
and then rate him for being no Christian.&nbsp; [Exit Fool.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Guta, there is sense in that knave&rsquo;s ribaldry:<br />We
must not thus baptize our idleness,<br />And call it resignation: Which
is love?<br />To do God&rsquo;s will, or merely suffer it?<br />I do
not love that contemplative life:<br />No!&nbsp; I must headlong into
seas of toil,<br />Leap forth from self, and spend my soul on others.<br />Oh!
contemplation palls upon the spirit,<br />Like the chill silence of
an autumn sun:<br />While action, like the roaring south-west wind,<br />Sweeps
laden with elixirs, with rich draughts<br />Quickening the wombed earth.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; And yet what bliss,<br />When dying in the darkness
of God&rsquo;s light,<br />The soul can pierce these blinding webs of
nature,<br />And float up to The Nothing, which is all things&mdash;<br />The
ground of being, where self-forgetful silence<br />Is emptiness,&mdash;emptiness
fulness,&mdash;fulness God,&mdash;<br />Till we touch Him, and like
a snow-flake, melt<br />Upon His light-sphere&rsquo;s keen circumference!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Hast thou felt this?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; In part.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, happy Guta!<br />Mine eyes are dim&mdash;and
what if I mistook<br />For God&rsquo;s own self, the phantoms of my
brain?<br />And who am I, that my own will&rsquo;s intent<br />Should
put me face to face with the living God?<br />I, thus thrust down from
the still lakes of thought<br />Upon a boiling crater-field of labour.<br />No!&nbsp;
He must come to me, not I to Him;<br />If I see God, beloved, I must
see Him<br />In mine own self:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Thyself?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Why start, my sister?<br />God is revealed in
the crucified:<br />The crucified must be revealed in me:&mdash;<br />I
must put on His righteousness; show forth<br />His sorrow&rsquo;s glory;
hunger, weep with Him;<br />Writhe with His stripes, and let this aching
flesh<br />Sink through His fiery baptism into death,<br />That I may
rise with Him, and in His likeness<br />May ceaseless heal the sick,
and soothe the sad,<br />And give away like Him this flesh and blood<br />To
feed His lambs&mdash;ay&mdash;we must die with Him<br />To sense&mdash;and
love&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; To love?&nbsp; What then becomes<br />Of marriage
vows?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I know it&mdash;so speak not of them.<br />Oh!
that&rsquo;s the flow, the chasm in all my longings,<br />Which I have
spanned with cobweb arguments,<br />Yet yawns before me still, where&rsquo;er
I turn,<br />To bar me from perfection; had I given<br />My virgin all
to Christ!&nbsp; I was not worthy!<br />I could not stand alone!</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Here comes your husband.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; He comes! my sun! and every thrilling vein<br />Proclaims
my weakness.</p>
<p>[Lewis enters.]</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Good news, my Princess; in the street below<br />Conrad,
the man of God from Marpurg, stands<br />And from a bourne-stone to
the simple folk<br />Does thunder doctrine, preaching faith, repentance,<br />And
dread of all foul heresies; his eyes<br />On heaven still set, save
when with searching frown<br />He lours upon the crowd, who round him
cower<br />Like quails beneath the hawk, and gape, and tremble,<br />Now
raised to heaven, now down again to hell.<br />I stood beside and heard;
like any doe&rsquo;s<br />My heart did rise and fall.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, let us hear him!<br />We too need warning;
shame, if we let pass,<br />Unentertained, God&rsquo;s angels on their
way.<br />Send for him, brother.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Let a knight go down<br />And say to the holy
man, the Landgrave Lewis<br />With humble greetings prays his blessedness<br />To
make these secular walls the spirit&rsquo;s temple<br />At least to-night.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Now go, my ladies, both&mdash;<br />Prepare fit
lodgings,&mdash;let your courtesies<br />Retain in our poor courts the
man of God.</p>
<p>[Exeunt.&nbsp; Lewis and Elizabeth are left alone.]</p>
<p>Now hear me, best beloved:&mdash;I have marked this man:<br />And
that which hath scared others, draws me towards him:<br />He has the
graces which I want; his sternness<br />I envy for its strength; his
fiery boldness<br />I call the earnestness which dares not trifle<br />With
life&rsquo;s huge stake; his coldness but the calm<br />Of one who long
hath found, and keeps unwavering,<br />Clear purpose still; he hath
the gift which speaks<br />The deepest things most simply; in his eye<br />I
dare be happy&mdash;weak I dare not be.<br />With such a guide,&mdash;to
save this little heart&mdash;<br />The burden of self-rule&mdash;Oh&mdash;half
my work<br />Were eased, and I could live for thee and thine,<br />And
take no thought of self.&nbsp; Oh, be not jealous,<br />Mine own, mine
idol!&nbsp; For thy sake I ask it&mdash;<br />I would but be a mate
and help more meet<br />For all thy knightly virtues.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too true!<br />I have felt it long;
we stand, two weakling children,<br />Under too huge a burden, while
temptations<br />Like adders swarm up round: I must be led&mdash;<br />But
thou alone shall lead me.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I? beloved!<br />This load more?&nbsp; Strengthen,
Lord, the feeble knees!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Yes! thou, my queen, who making thyself once
mine,<br />Hast made me sevenfold thine; I own thee guide<br />Of my
devotions, mine ambition&rsquo;s lodestar,<br />The Saint whose shrine
I serve with lance and lute;<br />If thou wilt have a ruler, let him
be,<br />Through thee, the ruler of thy slave.&nbsp; [Kneels to her.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, kneel not&mdash;<br />But grant my prayer&mdash;If
we shall find this man,<br />As well I know him, worthy, let him be<br />Director
of my conscience and my actions<br />With all but thee&mdash;Within
love&rsquo;s inner shrine<br />We shall be still alone&mdash;But joy!
here comes<br />Our embassy, successful.</p>
<p>[Enter Conrad, with Count Walter, Monks, Ladies, etc.]</p>
<p><i>Conrad</i>.&nbsp; Peace to this house.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Hail to your holiness.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; The odour of your sanctity and might,<br />With
balmy steam and gales of Paradise,<br />Forestalls you hither.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Bless us doubly, master,<br />With holy doctrine,
and with holy prayers.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Children, I am the servant of Christ&rsquo;s servants&mdash;<br />And
needs must yield to those who may command<br />By right of creed; I
do accept your bounty&mdash;<br />Not for myself, but for that priceless
name,<br />Whose dread authority and due commission,<br />Attested by
the seal of His vicegerent,<br />I bear unworthy here; through my vile
lips<br />Christ and His vicar thank you; on myself&mdash;<br />And
these, my brethren, Christ&rsquo;s adopted poor&mdash;<br />A menial&rsquo;s
crust, and some waste nook, or dog-hutch,<br />Wherein the worthless
flesh may nightly hide,<br />Are best bestowed.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; You shall be where you will&mdash;<br />Do what
you will; unquestioned, unobserved,<br />Enjoy, refrain; silence and
solitude,<br />The better part which such like spirits choose,<br />We
will provide; only be you our master,<br />And we your servants, for
a few short days:<br />Oh, blessed days!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Ah, be not hasty, madam;<br />Think whom you welcome;
one who has no skill<br />To wink and speak smooth things; whom fear
of God<br />Constrains to daily wrath; who brings, alas!<br />A sword,
not peace: within whose bones the word<br />Burns like a pent-up fire,
and makes him bold<br />If aught in you or yours shall seem amiss,<br />To
cry aloud and spare not; let me go&mdash;<br />To pray for you&mdash;as
I have done long time,<br />Is sweeter than to chide you.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Then your prayers<br />Shall drive home your rebukes;
for both we need you&mdash;<br />Our snares are many, and our sins are
more.<br />So say not nay&mdash;I&rsquo;ll speak with you apart.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth and Conrad retire.]</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i> [aside].&nbsp; Well, Walter mine, how like you the good
legate?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Walter has seen nought of him but his eye;<br />And
that don&rsquo;t please him.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; How so, sir! that face<br />Is pure and meek&mdash;a
calm and thoughtful eye.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; A shallow, stony, steadfast eye; that looks at
neither man nor beast in the face, but at something invisible a yard
before him, through you and past you, at a fascination, a ghost of fixed
purposes that haunts him, from which neither reason nor pity will turn
him.&nbsp; I have seen such an eye in men possessed&mdash;with devils,
or with self: sleek, passionless men, who are too refined to be manly,
and measure their grace by their effeminacy; crooked vermin, who swarm
up in pious times, being drowned out of their earthly haunts by the
spring-tide of religion; and so making a gain of godliness, swim upon
the first of the flood, till it cast them ashore on the firm beach of
wealth and station.&nbsp; I always mistrust those wall-eyed saints.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Beware, Sir Count; your keen and worldly wit<br />Is
good for worldly uses, not to tilt<br />Withal at holy men and holy
things.<br />He pleases well the spiritual sense<br />Of my most peerless
lady, whose discernment<br />Is still the touchstone of my grosser fancy:<br />He
is her friend, and mine: and you must love him<br />Even for our sakes
alone, [to a bystander]&nbsp; A word with you, sir.</p>
<p>[In the meantime Elizabeth and Conrad are talking together.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I would be taught&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; It seems you claim some knowledge,<br />By choosing
thus your teacher.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I would know more&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Go then to the schools&mdash;and be no wiser, madam;<br />And
let God&rsquo;s charge here run to waste, to seek<br />The bitter fruit
of knowledge&mdash;hunt the rainbow<br />O&rsquo;er hill and dale, while
wisdom rusts at home.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I would be holy, master&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Be so, then.<br />God&rsquo;s will stands fair:
&rsquo;tis thine which fails, if any.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I would know how to rule&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Then must thou learn<br />The needs of subjects,
and be ruled thyself.<br />Sink, if thou longest to rise; become most
small&mdash;<br />The strength which comes by weakness makes thee great.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I will.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; What, still at lessons?&nbsp; Come, my fairest
sister,<br />Usher the holy man unto his lodgings.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i> [alone].&nbsp; So, so, the birds are limed:&mdash;Heaven
grant that we do not soon see them stowed in separate cages.&nbsp; Well,
here my prophesying ends.&nbsp; I shall go to my lands, and see how
much the gentlemen my neighbours have stolen off them the last week,&mdash;Priests?&nbsp;
Frogs in the king&rsquo;s bedchamber!&nbsp; What says the song?</p>
<p>I once had a hound, a right good hound,<br />A hound both fleet and
strong:<br />He ate at my board, and he slept by my bed,<br />And ran
with me all the day long.<br />But my wife took a priest, a shaveling
priest,<br />And &lsquo;such friendships are carnal,&rsquo; quoth he.<br />So
my wife and her priest they drugged the poor beast,<br />And the rat&rsquo;s
bane is waiting for me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Gateway of a Convent.&nbsp; Night.</p>
<p>Enter Conrad.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; This night she swears obedience to me!&nbsp; Wondrous
Lord!<br />How hast Thou opened a path, where my young dreams<br />May
find fulfilment: there are prophecies<br />Upon her, make me bold.&nbsp;
Why comes she not?<br />She should be here by now.&nbsp; Strange, how
I shrink&mdash;<br />I, who ne&rsquo;er yet felt fear of man or fiend.<br />Obedience
to my will!&nbsp; An awful charge!<br />But yet, to have the training
of her sainthood;<br />To watch her rise above this wild world&rsquo;s
waves<br />Like floating water-lily, towards heaven&rsquo;s light<br />Opening
its virgin snows, with golden eye<br />Mirroring the golden sun; to
be her champion,<br />And war with fiends for her; that were a &lsquo;quest&rsquo;;<br />That
were true chivalry; to bring my Judge<br />This jewel for His crown;
this noble soul,<br />Worth thousand prudish clods of barren clay,<br />Who
mope for heaven because earth&rsquo;s grapes are sour&mdash;<br />Her,
full of youth, flushed with the heart&rsquo;s rich first-fruits,<br />Tangled
in earthly pomp&mdash;and earthly love.<br />Wife?&nbsp; Saint by her
face she should be: with such looks<br />The queen of heaven, perchance,
slow pacing came<br />Adown our sleeping wards, when Dominic<br />Sank
fainting, drunk with beauty:&mdash;she is most fair!<br />Pooh!&nbsp;
I know nought of fairness&mdash;this I know,<br />She calls herself
my slave, with such an air<br />As speaks her queen, not slave; that
shall be looked to&mdash;<br />She must be pinioned or she will range
abroad<br />Upon too bold a wing; &rsquo;t will cost her pain&mdash;<br />But
what of that? there are worse things than pain&mdash;<br />What! not
yet here?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll in, and there await her<br />In prayer before
the altar: I have need on&rsquo;t:<br />And shall have more before this
harvest&rsquo;s ripe.</p>
<p>[As Conrad goes out, Elizabeth, Isentrudis, and Guta enter.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I saw him just before us: let us onward;<br />We
must not seem to loiter.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Then you promise<br />Exact obedience to his sole
direction<br />Henceforth in every scruple?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; In all I can,<br />And be a wife.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Is it not a double bondage?<br />A husband&rsquo;s
will is clog enough.&nbsp; Be sure,<br />Though free, I crave more freedom.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; So do I&mdash;<br />This servitude shall free
me&mdash;from myself.<br />Therefore I&rsquo;ll swear.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; To what?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I know not wholly:<br />But this I know, that
I shall swear to-night<br />To yield my will unto a wiser will;<br />To
see God&rsquo;s truth through eyes which, like the eagle&rsquo;s,<br />From
higher Alps undazzled eye the sun.<br />Compelled to discipline from
which my sloth<br />Would shrink, unbidden,&mdash;to deep devious paths<br />Which
my dull sight would miss, I now can plunge,<br />And dare life&rsquo;s
eddies fearless.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; You will repent it.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I do repent, even now.&nbsp; Therefore I&rsquo;ll
swear.<br />And bind myself to that, which once being light,<br />Will
not be less right, when I shrink from it.<br />No; if the end be gained&mdash;if
I be raised<br />To freer, nobler use, I&rsquo;ll dare, I&rsquo;ll welcome<br />Him
and his means, though they were racks and flames.<br />Come, ladies,
let us in, and to the chapel.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Chamber.&nbsp; Guta, Isentrudis, and a Lady.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; Doubtless she is most holy&mdash;but for wisdom&mdash;<br />Say
if &rsquo;tis wise to spurn all rules, all censures,<br />And mountebank
it in the public ways<br />Till she becomes a jest?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; For one thing&mdash;<br />Yestreen I passed her
in the open street,<br />Following the vocal line of chanting priests,<br />Clad
in rough serge, and with her soft bare feet<br />Wooing the ruthless
flints; the gaping crowd<br />Unknowing whom they held, did thrust and
jostle<br />Her tender limbs; she saw me as she passed&mdash;<br />And
blushed and veiled her face, and smiled withal.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Oh, think, she&rsquo;s not seventeen yet.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Why expect<br />Wisdom with love in all?&nbsp;
Each has his gift&mdash;<br />Our souls are organ pipes of diverse stop<br />And
various pitch; each with its proper notes<br />Thrilling beneath the
self-same breath of God.<br />Though poor alone, yet joined, they&rsquo;re
harmony.<br />Besides these higher spirits must not bend<br />To common
methods; in their inner world<br />They move by broader laws, at whose
expression<br />We must adore, not cavil: here she comes&mdash;<br />The
ministering Saint, fresh from the poor of Christ.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth enters without cloak or shoes, carrying an empty basket.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here, my Princess?&nbsp; Guta, fetch
her robes!<br />Rest, rest, my child!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i> [throwing herself on a seat]&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I have seen
such things!<br />I shudder still; your gay looks dazzle me;<br />As
those who long in hideous darkness pent<br />Blink at the daily light;
this room&rsquo;s too bright!<br />We sit in a cloud, and sing, like
pictured angels,<br />And say, the world runs smooth&mdash;while right
below<br />Welters the black fermenting heap of life<br />On which our
state is built: I saw this day<br />What we might be, and still be Christian
women:<br />And mothers too&mdash;I saw one, laid in childbed<br />These
three cold weeks upon the black damp straw;<br />No nurses, cordials,
or that nice parade<br />With which we try to balk the curse of Eve&mdash;<br />And
yet she laughed, and showed her buxom boy,<br />And said, Another week,
so please the Saints,<br />She&rsquo;d be at work a-field.&nbsp; Look
here&mdash;and here&mdash;</p>
<p>[Pointing round the room.]</p>
<p>I saw no such things there; and yet they lived.<br />Our wanton accidents
take root, and grow<br />To vaunt themselves God&rsquo;s laws, until
our clothes,<br />Our gems, and gaudy books, and cushioned litters<br />Become
ourselves, and we would fain forget<br />There live who need them not.&nbsp;
[Guta offers to robe her.]<br />Let be, beloved&mdash;<br />I will taste
somewhat this same poverty&mdash;<br />Try these temptations, grudges,
gnawing shames,<br />For which &rsquo;tis blamed; how probe an unfelt
evil?<br />Would&rsquo;st be the poor man&rsquo;s friend?&nbsp; Must
freeze with him&mdash;<br />Test sleepless hunger&mdash;let thy crippled
back<br />Ache o&rsquo;er the endless furrow; how was He,<br />The blessed
One, made perfect?&nbsp; Why, by grief&mdash;<br />The fellowship of
voluntary grief&mdash;<br />He read the tear-stained book of poor men&rsquo;s
souls,<br />As I must learn to read it.&nbsp; Lady! lady!<br />Wear
but one robe the less&mdash;forego one meal&mdash;<br />And thou shalt
taste the core of many tales<br />Which now flit past thee, like a minstrel&rsquo;s
songs,<br />The sweeter for their sadness.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; Heavenly wisdom!<br />Forgive me!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; What wrong is mine, fair dame?</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; I thought you, to my shame&mdash;less wise than
holy.<br />But you have conquered: I will test these sorrows<br />On
mine own person; I have toyed too long<br />In painted pinnace down
the stream of life,<br />Witched with the landscape, while the weary
rowers<br />Faint at the groaning oar: I&rsquo;ll be thy pupil.<br />Farewell.&nbsp;
Heaven bless thy labours and thy lesson.</p>
<p>[Exit.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; We are alone.&nbsp; Now tell me, dearest lady,<br />How
came you in this plight?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! chide not, nurse&mdash;<br />My heart is full&mdash;and
yet I went not far&mdash;<br />Even here, close by, where my own bower
looks down<br />Upon that unknown sea of wavy roofs,<br />I turned into
an alley &rsquo;neath the wall&mdash;<br />And stepped from earth to
hell.&mdash;The light of heaven,<br />The common air, was narrow, gross,
and dun;<br />The tiles did drop from the eaves; the unhinged doors<br />Tottered
o&rsquo;er inky pools, where reeked and curdled<br />The offal of a
life; the gaunt-haunched swine<br />Growled at their christened playmates
o&rsquo;er the scraps.<br />Shrill mothers cursed; wan children wailed;
sharp coughs<br />Rang through the crazy chambers; hungry eyes<br />Glared
dumb reproach, and old perplexity,<br />Too stale for words; o&rsquo;er
still and webless looms<br />The listless craftsmen through their elf-locks
scowled;<br />These were my people! all I had, I gave&mdash;<br />They
snatched it thankless (was it not their own?<br />Wrung from their veins,
returning all too late?);<br />Or in the new delight of rare possession,<br />Forgot
the giver; one did sit apart,<br />And shivered on a stone; beneath
her rags<br />Nestled two impish, fleshless, leering boys,<br />Grown
old before their youth; they cried for bread&mdash;<br />She chid them
down, and hid her face and wept;<br />I had given all&mdash;I took my
cloak, my shoes<br />(What could I else?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but a moment&rsquo;s
want<br />Which she had borne, and borne, day after day),<br />And clothed
her bare gaunt arms and purpled feet,<br />Then slunk ashamed away to
wealth and honour.</p>
<p>[Conrad enters.]</p>
<p>What!&nbsp; Conrad? unannounced!&nbsp; This is too bold!<br />Peace!&nbsp;
I have lent myself&mdash;and I must take<br />The usury of that loan:
your pleasure, master?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Madam, but yesterday, I bade your presence,<br />To
hear the preached word of God; I preached&mdash;<br />And yet you came
not.&mdash;Where is now your oath?<br />Where is the right to bid, you
gave to me?<br />Am I your ghostly guide?&nbsp; I asked it not.<br />Of
your own will you tendered that, which, given,<br />Became not choice,
but duty.&mdash;What is here?<br />Think not that alms, or lowly-seeming
garments,<br />Self-willed humilities, pride&rsquo;s decent mummers,<br />Can
raise above obedience; she from God<br />Her sanction draws, while these
we forge ourselves,<br />Mere tools to clear her necessary path.<br />Go
free&mdash;thou art no slave: God doth not own<br />Unwilling service,
and His ministers<br />Must lure, not drag in leash; henceforth I leave
thee:<br />Riot in thy self-willed fancies; pick thy steps<br />By thine
own will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp toward the pit;<br />Farewell, proud girl.&nbsp;
[Exit Conrad.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; What have I done?<br />I have cast
off the clue of this world&rsquo;s maze,<br />And, like an idiot, let
my boat adrift<br />Above the waterfall!&mdash;I had no message&mdash;<br />How&rsquo;s
this?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; We passed it by, as matter of no moment<br />Upon
the sudden coming of your guests.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; No moment!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis enough to have driven
him forth&mdash;<br />And that&rsquo;s enough to damn me: I&rsquo;ll
not chide you&mdash;<br />I can see nothing but my loss; I&rsquo;ll
to him&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll go in sackcloth, bathe his feet with tears&mdash;<br />And
know nor sleep nor food till I am forgiven&mdash;<br />And you must
with me, ladies.&nbsp; Come and find him.</p>
<p>[Exeunt.]</p>

<h3>SCENE V</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Hall in the Castle.&nbsp; In the background a Group of diseased
and deformed Beggars; Conrad entering, Elizabeth comes forward to meet
him.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; What dost thou, daughter?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah, my honoured master!<br />That name speaks
pardon, sure.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; What dost thou, daughter?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I have been washing these poor people&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; A wise humiliation.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; So I meant it&mdash;<br />And use it as a penance
for my pride;<br />And yet, alas, through my own vulgar likings<br />Or
stubborn self-conceit, &rsquo;tis none to me.<br />I marvel how the
Saints thus tamed their spirits:<br />Sure to be humbled by such toil,
but proves,<br />Not cures, our lofty mind.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Thou speakest well&mdash;<br />The knave who serves
unto another&rsquo;s needs<br />Knows himself abler than the man who
needs him;<br />And she who stoops, will not forget, that stooping<br />Implies
a height to stoop from.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Could I see<br />My Saviour in His poor!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Thou shall hereafter:<br />But now to wash Christ&rsquo;s
feet were dangerous honour<br />For weakling grace; would you be humble,
daughter,<br />You must look up, not down, and see yourself<br />A paltry
atom, sap-transmitting vein<br />Of Christ&rsquo;s vast vine; the pettiest
joint and member<br />Of His great body; own no strength, no will,<br />Save
that which from the ruling head&rsquo;s command<br />Through me, as
nerve, derives; let thyself die&mdash;<br />And dying, rise again to
fuller life.<br />To be a whole is to be small and weak&mdash;<br />To
be a part is to be great and mighty<br />In the one spirit of the mighty
whole&mdash;<br />The spirit of the martyrs and the saints&mdash;<br />The
spirit of the queen, on whose towered neck<br />We hang, blest ringlets!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Why! thine eyes flash fire!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; But hush! such words are not for courts and halls&mdash;<br />Alone
with God and me, thou shalt hear more.</p>
<p>[Exit Conrad.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; As when rich chanting ceases suddenly&mdash;<br />And
the rapt sense collapses!&mdash;Oh that Lewis<br />Could feed my soul
thus!&nbsp; But to work&mdash;to work&mdash;<br />What wilt thou, little
maid?&nbsp; Ah, I forgot thee&mdash;<br />Thy mother lies in childbed&mdash;Say,
in time<br />I&rsquo;ll bring the baby to the font myself.<br />It knits
them unto me, and me to them,<br />That bond of sponsorship&mdash;How
now, good dame&mdash;<br />Whence then so sad?</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; An&rsquo;t please your nobleness,<br />My neighbour
Gretl is with her husband laid<br />In burning fever.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I will come to them.</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Alack, the place is foul for such as you;<br />And
fear of plague has cleared the lane of lodgers;<br />If you could send&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What? where I am afraid<br />To go myself, send
others?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s strange doctrine.<br />I&rsquo;ll be with
you anon.&nbsp; [Goes up into the Hall.]</p>
<p>[Isentrudis enters with a basket.]</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Why, here&rsquo;s a weight&mdash;these cordials
now, and simples,<br />Want a stout page to bear them: yet her fancy<br />Is
still to go alone, to help herself.&mdash;<br />Where will &rsquo;t
all end?&nbsp; In madness, or the grave?<br />No limbs can stand these
drudgeries: no spirit<br />The fretting harrow which this ruffian priest<br />Calls
education&mdash;<br />Ah! here comes our Count.</p>
<p>[Count Walter enters as from a journey.]</p>
<p>Too late, sir, and too seldom&mdash;Where have you been<br />These
four months past, while we are sold for bond-slaves<br />Unto a peevish
friar?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why, my fair rosebud&mdash;<br />A trifle overblown,
but not less sweet&mdash;<br />I have been pining for you, till my hair<br />Is
as gray as any badger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not jest.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; What? has my wall-eyed Saint shown you his temper?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; The first of his peevish fancies was, that she
should eat nothing which was not honestly and peaceably come by.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why, I heard that you too had joined that sect.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; And more fool I.&nbsp; But ladies are bound to
set an example&mdash;while they are not bound to ask where everything
comes from: with her, poor child, scruples and starvation were her daily
diet; meal after meal she rose from table empty, unless the Landgrave
nodded and winked her to some lawful eatable; till she that used to
take her food like an angel, without knowing it, was thinking from morning
to night whether she might eat this, that, or the other.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Poor Eves! if the world leaves you innocent, the
Church will not.&nbsp; Between the devil and the director, you are sure
to get your share of the apples of knowledge.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; True enough.&nbsp; She complained to Conrad of
her scruples, and he told her, that by the law was the knowledge of
sin.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; But what said Lewis?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; As much bewitched as she, sir.&nbsp; He has told
her, and more than her, that were it not for the laughter and ill-will
of his barons, he would join her in the same abstinence.&nbsp; But all
this is child&rsquo;s play to the friar&rsquo;s last outbreak.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ah! the sermon which you all forgot, when the Marchioness
of Misnia came suddenly?&nbsp; I heard that war had been proclaimed
on that score; but what terms of peace were concluded?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Terms of peace!&nbsp; Do you call it peace to
be delivered over to his nuns&rsquo; tender mercies, myself and Guta,
as well as our lady,&mdash;as if we had been bond-slaves and blackamoors?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; You need not have submitted.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What! could I bear to see my poor child wandering
up and down, wringing her hands like a mad woman&mdash;I who have lived
for no one else this sixteen years?&nbsp; Guta talked sentiment&mdash;called
it a glorious cross, and so forth.&mdash;I took it as it came.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; And got no quarter, I&rsquo;ll warrant.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk of it&mdash;my poor back tingles
at the thought.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; The sweet Saints think every woman of the world
no better than she should be; and without meaning to be envious, owe
you all a grudge for past flirtations.&nbsp; As I am a knight, now it&rsquo;s
over, I like you all the better for it.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; When I see a woman who will stand by her word,
and two who will stand by their mistress.&nbsp; And the monk, too&mdash;there&rsquo;s
mettle in him.&nbsp; I took him for a canting carpet-haunter; but be
sure, the man who will bully his own patrons has an honest purpose in
him, though it bears strange fruit on this wicked hither-side of the
grave.&nbsp; Now, my fair nymph of the birchen-tree, use your interest
to find me supper and lodging; for your elegant squires of the trencher
look surly on me here: I am the prophet who has no honour in his own
country.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE VI</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Dawn.&nbsp; A rocky path leading to a mountain Chapel.&nbsp; A Peasant
sitting on a stone with dog and cross-bow.</p>
<p>Peasant [singing].</p>
<p>Over the wild moor, in reddest dawn of morning,<br />Gaily the huntsman
down green droves must roam:<br />Over the wild moor, in grayest wane
of evening,<br />Weary the huntsman comes wandering home;<br />Home,
home,<br />If he has one.&nbsp; Who comes here?</p>
<p>[A Woodcutter enters with a laden ass.]</p>
<p>What art going about?</p>
<p><i>Woodcutter</i>.&nbsp; To warm other folks&rsquo; backs.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Thou art in the common lot&mdash;Jack earns and
Gill spends&mdash;therein lies the true division of labour.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
thy name?</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Be&rsquo;est a keeper, man, or a charmer, that
dost so catechise me?</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Both&mdash;I am a keeper, for I keep all I catch;
and a charmer, for I drive bad spirits out of honest men&rsquo;s turnips.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Mary sain us, what be they like?</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Four-legged kitchens of leather, cooking farmers&rsquo;
crops into butcher&rsquo;s meat by night, without leave or licence.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; By token, thou&rsquo;rt a deer-stealer?</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Stealer, quoth he?&nbsp; I have dominion.&nbsp;
I do what I like with mine own.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Thine own?</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Yea, marry&mdash;for, saith the priest, man has
dominion over the beast of the field and the fowl of the air: so I,
being as I am a man, as men go, have dominion over the deer in my trade,
as you have in yours over sleep-mice and woodpeckers.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Then every man has a right to be a poacher.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Every man has his gift, and the tools go to him
that can use them.&nbsp; Some are born workmen; some have souls above
work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m one of that metal.&nbsp; I was meant to own land,
and do nothing; but the angel that deals out babies&rsquo; souls, mistook
the cradles, and spoilt a gallant gentleman!&nbsp; Well&mdash;I forgive
him! there were many born the same night&mdash;and work wears the wits.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; I had sooner draw in a yoke than hunt in a halter.<br />Hadst
best repent and mend thy ways.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; The way-warden may do that: I wear out no ways,
I go across country.&nbsp; Mend! saith he?&nbsp; Why I can but starve
at worst, or groan with the rheumatism, which you do already.&nbsp;
And who would reek and wallow o&rsquo; nights in the same straw, like
a stalled cow, when he may have his choice of all the clean holly bushes
in the forest?&nbsp; Who would grub out his life in the same croft,
when he has free-warren of all fields between this and Rhine?&nbsp;
Not I.&nbsp; I have dirtied my share of spades myself; but I slipped
my leash and went self-hunting.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; But what if thou be caught and brought up before
the Prince?</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; He don&rsquo;t care for game.&nbsp; He has put
down his kennel, and keeps a tame saint instead: and when I am driven
in, I shall ask my pardon of her in St. John&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; They
say that for his sake she&rsquo;ll give away the shoes off her feet.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; I would not stand in your shoes for all the top
and lop in the forest.&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp; Here comes a ghost!&nbsp;
Run up the bank&mdash;shove the jackass into the ditch.</p>
<p>[A white figure comes up the path with lights.]</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; A ghost or a watchman, and one&rsquo;s as bad
as the other&mdash;so we may take to cover for the time.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth enters, meanly clad, carrying her new-born infant; Isentrudis
following with a taper and gold pieces on a salver.&nbsp; Elizabeth
passes, singing.]</p>
<p>Deep in the warm vale the village is sleeping,<br />Sleeping the
firs on the bleak rock above;<br />Nought wakes, save grateful hearts,
silently creeping<br />Up to the Lord in the might of their love.</p>
<p>What Thou hast given to me, Lord, here I bring Thee,<br />Odour,
and light, and the magic of gold;<br />Feet which must follow Thee,
lips which must sing Thee,<br />Limbs which must ache for Thee ere they
grow old.</p>
<p>What Thou hast given to me, Lord, here I tender,<br />Life of mine
own life, the fruit of my love;<br />Take him, yet leave him me, till
I shall render<br />Count of the precious charge, kneeling above.</p>
<p>[They pass up the path.&nbsp; The Peasants come out.]</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; No ghost, but a mighty pretty wench, with a mighty
sweet voice.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Wench, indeed?&nbsp; Where be thy manners?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis her Ladyship&mdash;the Princess.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; The Princess!&nbsp; Ay, I thought those little
white feet were but lately out of broadcloth&mdash;still, I say, a mighty
sweet voice&mdash;I wish she had not sung so sweetly&mdash;it makes
things to arise in a body&rsquo;s head, does that singing: a wonderful
handsome lady! a royal lady!</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; But a most unwise one.&nbsp; Did ye mind the
gold?&nbsp; If I had such a trencherful, it should sleep warm in a stocking,
instead of being made a brother to owls here, for every rogue to snatch
at.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Why, then? who dare harm such as her, man?</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Nay, nay, none of us, we are poor folks, we fear
God and the king.&nbsp; But if she had met a gentleman now&mdash;heaven
help her!&nbsp; Ah! thou hast lost a chance&mdash;thou might&rsquo;st
have run out promiscuously, and down on thy knees, and begged thy pardon
for the newcomer&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; There was a chance, indeed.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Pooh, man, I have done nothing but lose chances
all my days.&nbsp; I fell into the fire the day I was christened, and
ever since I am like a fresh-trimmed fir-tree; every foul feather sticks
to me.</p>
<p><i>Woodc</i>.&nbsp; Go, shrive thyself, and the priest will scrub
off thy turpentine with a new haircloth; and now, good-day, the maids
are a-waiting for their firewood.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; A word before you go&mdash;Take warning by me&mdash;avoid
that same serpent, wisdom&mdash;Pray to the Saints to make you a blockhead&mdash;Never
send your boys to school&mdash;For Heaven knows, a poor man that will
live honest, and die in his bed, ought to have no more scholarship than
a parson, and no more brains than your jackass.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Gateway of a Castle.&nbsp; Elizabeth and her suite standing at
the top of a flight of steps.&nbsp; Mob below.</p>
<p><i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Bread!&nbsp; Bread!&nbsp; Bread! give us bread;
we perish.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; Ay, give, give, give!&nbsp; God knows,
we&rsquo;re long past earning.</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; Our skeleton children lie along in
the roads&mdash;</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; Our sheep drop dead about the frozen
leas&mdash;</p>
<p><i>4th</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; Our harness and our shoes are boiled
for food&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Old</i> <i>Man&rsquo;s</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; Starved, withered,
autumn hay that thanks the scythe!<br />Send out your swordsmen, mow
the dry bents down,<br />And make this long death short&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
never struggle.</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&nbsp; Bread!&nbsp; Bread!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ay, bread&mdash;Where is it, knights and servants?<br />Why
butler, seneschal, this food forthcomes not!</p>
<p><i>Butler</i>.&nbsp; Alas, we&rsquo;ve eaten all ourselves: heaven
knows<br />The pages broke the buttery hatches down&mdash;<br />The
boys were starved almost.</p>
<p><i>Voice</i> <i>below</i>.&nbsp; Ay, she can find enough to feast
her minions.</p>
<p><i>Woman&rsquo;s</i> <i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; How can she know what &rsquo;tis,
for months and months<br />To stoop and straddle in the clogging fallows,<br />Bearing
about a living babe within you?<br />And then at night to fat yourself
and it<br />On fir-bark, madam, and water.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; My good dame&mdash;<br />That which you bear,
I bear: for food, God knows,<br />I have not tasted food this live-long
day&mdash;<br />Nor will till you are served.&nbsp; I sent for wheat<br />From
K&ouml;ln and from the Rhine-land, days ago:<br />O God! why comes it
not?</p>
<p>[Enter from below, Count Walter, with a Merchant.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Stand back; you&rsquo;ll choke me, rascals:<br />Archers,
bring up those mules.&nbsp; Here comes the corn&mdash;<br />Here comes
your guardian angel, plenty-laden,<br />With no white wings, but good
white wheat, my boys,<br />Quarters on quarters&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll
pay for it.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! give him all he asks.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; The scoundrel wants<br />Three times its value.</p>
<p><i>Merchant</i>.&nbsp; Not a penny less&mdash;<br />I bought it on
speculation&mdash;I must live&mdash;<br />I get my bread by buying corn
that&rsquo;s cheap,<br />And selling where &rsquo;tis dearest.&nbsp;
Mass, you need it,<br />And you must pay according to your need.</p>
<p><i>Mob</i>.&nbsp; Hang him! hang all regraters&mdash;hang the forestalling
dog!</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Driver, lend here the halter off that mule.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Nay, Count; the corn is his, and his the right<br />To
fix conditions for his own.</p>
<p><i>Mer</i>.&nbsp; Well spoken!<br />A wise and royal lady!&nbsp;
She will see<br />The trade protected.&nbsp; Why, I kept the corn<br />Three
months on venture.&nbsp; Now, so help me Saints,<br />I am a loser by
it, quite a loser&mdash;<br />So help me Saints, I am.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; You will not sell it<br />Save at a price which,
by the bill you tender,<br />Is far beyond our means.&nbsp; Heaven knows,
I grudge not&mdash;<br />I have sold my plate, have pawned my robes
and jewels.<br />Mortgaged broad lands and castles to buy food&mdash;<br />And
now I have no more.&mdash;Abate, or trust<br />Our honour for the difference.</p>
<p><i>Mer</i>.&nbsp; Not a penny&mdash;<br />I trust no nobles.&nbsp;
I must make my profit&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll have my price, or take
it back again.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Most miserable, cold, short-sighted man,<br />Who
for thy selfish gains dost welcome make<br />God&rsquo;s wrath, and
battenest on thy fellows&rsquo; woes,<br />What? wilt thou turn from
heaven&rsquo;s gate, open to thee,<br />Through which thy charity may
passport be,<br />And win thy long greed&rsquo;s pardon?&nbsp; Oh, for
once<br />Dare to be great; show mercy to thyself!<br />See how that
boiling sea of human heads<br />Waits open-mouthed to bless thee: speak
the word,<br />And their triumphant quire of jubilation<br />Shall pierce
God&rsquo;s cloudy floor with praise and prayers,<br />And drown the
accuser&rsquo;s count in angels&rsquo; ears.</p>
<p>[In the meantime Walter, etc., have been throwing down the wheat
to the mob.]</p>
<p><i>Mob</i>.&nbsp; God bless the good Count!&mdash;Bless the holy
Princess&mdash;<br />Hurrah for wheat&mdash;Hurrah for one full stomach.</p>
<p><i>Mer</i>.&nbsp; Ah! that&rsquo;s my wheat! treason, my wheat, my
money!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Where is the wretch&rsquo;s wheat?</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Below, my lady;<br />We counted on the charm of
your sweet words,<br />And so did for him what, your sermon ended,<br />He
would have done himself.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere rude to doubt it.</p>
<p><i>Mer</i>.&nbsp; Ye rascal barons!<br />What!&nbsp; Are we burghers
monkeys for your pastime?<br />We&rsquo;ll clear the odds.&nbsp; [Seizes
Walter.]</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Soft, friend&mdash;a worm will turn.</p>
<p><i>Voices</i> <i>below</i>.&nbsp; Throw him down.</p>
<p><i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Dost hear that, friend?<br />Those pups are keen-toothed;
they have eat of late<br />Worse bacon to their bread than thee.&nbsp;
Come, come,<br />Put up thy knife; we&rsquo;ll give thee market-price&mdash;<br />And
if thou must have more&mdash;why, take it out<br />In board and lodging
in the castle dungeon.</p>
<p>[Walter leads him out; the Mob, etc., disperse.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Now then&mdash;there&rsquo;s many a one lies faint
at home&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll go to them myself.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What now? start forth<br />In this most bitter
frost, so thinly clad?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Tut, tut, I wear my working dress to-day,<br />And
those who work, robe lightly&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Nay, my child,<br />For once keep up your rank.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Then I had best<br />Roll to their door in lacqueyed
equipage,<br />And dole my halfpence from my satin purse&mdash;<br />I
am their sister&mdash;I must look like one.<br />I am their queen&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
prove myself the greatest<br />By being the minister of all.&nbsp; So
come&mdash;<br />Now to my pastime, [aside]&nbsp; And in happy toil<br />Forget
this whirl of doubt&mdash;We are weak, we are weak,<br />Only when still:
put thou thine hand to the plough,<br />The spirit drives thee on.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; You live too fast!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Too fast?&nbsp; We live too slow&mdash;our gummy
blood<br />Without fresh purging airs from heaven, would choke<br />Slower
and slower, till it stopped and froze.<br />God! fight we not within
a cursed world,<br />Whose very air teems thick with leagued fiends&mdash;<br />Each
word we speak has infinite effects&mdash;<br />Each soul we pass must
go to heaven or hell&mdash;<br />And this our one chance through eternity<br />To
drop and die, like dead leaves in the brake,<br />Or like the meteor
stone, though whelmed itself,<br />Kindle the dry moors into fruitful
blaze&mdash;<br />And yet we live too fast!<br />Be earnest, earnest,
earnest; mad, if thou wilt:<br />Do what thou dost as if the stake were
heaven,<br />And that thy last deed ere the judgment-day.<br />When
all&rsquo;s done, nothing&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s rest above&mdash;<br />Below
let work be death, if work be love!&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Chamber in the Castle.&nbsp; Counts Walter, Hugo, etc., Abbot,
and Knights.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t forget it, as I am
a Christian man.&nbsp; To ask for a stoup of beer at breakfast, and
be told there was no beer allowed in the house&mdash;her Ladyship had
given all the malt to the poor.</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; To give away the staff of life, eh?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; The life itself, Sir, the life itself.&nbsp;
All that barley, that would have warmed many an honest fellow&rsquo;s
coppers, wasted in filthy cakes.</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; The parent of seraphic ale degraded into plebeian
dough!&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, we have no right to lessen wantonly the amount
of human enjoyment!</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; In heaven&rsquo;s name, what would you
have her do, while the people were eating grass?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; Nobody asked them to eat it; nobody
asked them to be there to eat it; if they will breed like rabbits, let
them feed like rabbits, say I&mdash;I never married till I could keep
a wife.</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Ah, Count Walter!&nbsp; How sad to see a man
of your sense so led away by his feelings!&nbsp; Had but this dispensation
been left to work itself out, and evolve the blessing implicit in all
heaven&rsquo;s chastenings!&nbsp; Had but the stern benevolences of
providence remained undisturbed by her ladyship&rsquo;s carnal tenderness&mdash;what
a boon had this famine been!</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; How then, man?</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; How many a poor soul would be lying&mdash;Ah,
blessed thought!&mdash;in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom; who must now toil on
still in this vale of tears!&mdash;Pardon this pathetic dew&mdash;I
cannot but feel as a Churchman.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Look at it in this way, Sir.&nbsp;
There are too many of us&mdash;too many&mdash;Where you have one job
you have three workmen.&nbsp; Why, I threw three hundred acres into
pasture myself this year&mdash;it saves money, and risk, and trouble,
and tithes.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; What would you say to the Princess, who
talks of breaking up all her parks to wheat next year?</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Ask her to take on the thirty families,
who were just going to tramp off those three hundred acres into the
Rhine-land, if she had not kept them in both senses this winter, and
left them on my hands&mdash;once beggars, always beggars.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m a practical man, and
I say, the sharper the famine, the higher are prices, and the higher
I sell, the more I can spend; so the money circulates, Sir, that&rsquo;s
the word&mdash;like water&mdash;sure to run downwards again; and so
it&rsquo;s as broad as it&rsquo;s long; and here&rsquo;s a health&mdash;if
there was any beer&mdash;to the farmers&rsquo; friends, &lsquo;A bloody
war and a wet harvest.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Strongly put, though correctly.&nbsp; For the
self-interest of each it is which produces in the aggregate the happy
equilibrium of all.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;the world is right well made,
that&rsquo;s certain; and He who made the Jews&rsquo; sin our salvation
may bring plenty out of famine, and comfort out of covetousness.&nbsp;
But look you, Sirs, private selfishness may be public weal, and yet
private selfishness be just as surely damned, for all that.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; I hold, Sir, that every alms is a fresh
badge of slavery.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t deny it.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Then teach them independence.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; By tempting them to turn thieves,
when begging fails?&nbsp; By keeping their stomachs just at desperation-point?&nbsp;
By starving them out here, to march off, starving all the way, to some
town, in search of employment, of which, if they find it, they know
no more than my horse?&nbsp; Likely!&nbsp; No, Sir, to make men of them,
put them not out of the reach, but out of the need, of charity.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; And how, prithee?&nbsp; By teaching
them, like our fair Landgravine, to open their mouth for all that drops?&nbsp;
Thuringia is become a kennel of beggars in her hands.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; In hers?&nbsp; In ours, Sir!</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Idleness, Sir, deceit, and immorality, are the
three children of this same barbarous self-indulgence in almsgiving.&nbsp;
Leave the poor alone.&nbsp; Let want teach them the need of self-exertion,
and misery prove the foolishness of crime.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Teach them to become men by
leaving them brutes?</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Oh, Sir, there we step in, with the consolations
and instructions of the faith.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ay, but while the grass is growing the
steed is starving; and in the meantime, how will the callow chick Grace
stand against the tough old game-cock Hunger?</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Then how, in the name of patience,
would you have us alter things?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; We cannot alter them, Sir&mdash;but they
will be altered, never fear.</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; How?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Do you see this hour-glass?&mdash;Here&rsquo;s
the state:<br />This air stands for the idlers;&mdash;this sand for
the workers.<br />When all the sand has run to the bottom, God in heaven
just turns the hour-glass, and then&mdash;</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s upside down.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; And the Lord have mercy upon us!</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; On us?&nbsp; Do you call us the idlers?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Some dare to do so&mdash;But fear not&mdash;In
the fulness of time, all that&rsquo;s lightest is sure to come to the
top again.</p>
<p><i>C</i>.&nbsp; <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; But what rascal calls us idlers?</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; Name, name.</p>
<p><i>C</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why, if you ask me&mdash;I heard
a shrewd sermon the other day on that same idleness and immorality text
of the Abbot&rsquo;s.&mdash;&rsquo;Twas Conrad, the Princess&rsquo;s
director, preached it.&nbsp; And a fashionable cap it is, though it
will fit more than will like to wear it.&nbsp; Shall I give it you?&nbsp;
Shall I preach?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; A tub for Varila!&nbsp; Stand on the
table, now, toss back thy hood like any Franciscan, and preach away.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Idleness, quoth he [Conrad, mind you],&mdash;idleness
and immorality?&nbsp; Where have they learnt them, but from your nobles?&nbsp;
There was a saucy monk for you.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s worse coming.&nbsp;
Religion? said he, how can they respect it, when they see you, &lsquo;their
betters,&rsquo; fattening on church lands, neglecting sacraments, defying
excommunications, trading in benefices, hiring the clergy for your puppets
and flatterers, making the ministry, the episcopate itself, a lumber-room
wherein to stow away the idiots and spendthrifts of your families, the
confidants of your mistresses, the cast-off pedagogues of your boys?</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; The scoundrel!</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Was he not?&mdash;But hear again&mdash;Immorality?
roars he; and who has corrupted them but you?&nbsp; Have you not made
every castle a weed-bed, from which the newest corruptions of the Court
stick like thistle-down, about the empty heads of stable-boys and serving
maids?&nbsp; Have you not kept the poor worse housed than your dogs
and your horses, worse fed than your pigs and your sheep?&nbsp; Is there
an ancient house among you, again, of which village gossips do not whisper
some dark story of lust and oppression, of decrepit debauchery, of hereditary
doom?</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hang this monk.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Hear me out, and you&rsquo;ll burn him.&nbsp;
His sermon was like a hailstorm, the tail of the shower the sharpest.&nbsp;
Idleness? he asked next of us all: how will they work, when they see
you landlords sitting idle above them, in a fool&rsquo;s paradise of
luxury and riot, never looking down but to squeeze from them an extra
drop of honey&mdash;like sheep-boys stuffing themselves with blackberries
while the sheep are licking up flukes in every ditch?&nbsp; And now
you wish to leave the poor man in the slough, whither your neglect and
your example have betrayed him, and made his too apt scholarship the
excuse for your own remorseless greed!&nbsp; As a Christian, I am ashamed
of you all; as a Churchman, doubly ashamed of those prelates, hired
stalking-horses of the rich, who would fain gloss over their own sloth
and cowardice with the wisdom which cometh not from above, but is earthly,
sensual, devilish; aping the artless cant of an aristocracy who made
them&mdash;use them&mdash;and despise them.&nbsp; That was his sermon.</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Paul and Barnabas!&nbsp; What an outpouring of
the spirit!&mdash;Were not his hoodship the Pope&rsquo;s legate, now&mdash;accidents
might happen to him, going home at night; eh, Sir Hugo?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; If he would but come my way!<br />For
&lsquo;the mule it was slow, and the lane it was dark,<br />When out
of the copse leapt a gallant young spark.<br />Says, &rsquo;Tis not
for nought you&rsquo;ve been begging all day:<br />So remember your
toll, since you travel our way.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; Here comes the Landgrave.</p>
<p>[Lewis enters.]</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Good morrow, gentles.&nbsp; Why so warm, Count
Walter?<br />Your blessing, Father Abbot: what deep matters<br />Have
called our worships to this conference?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i> [aside].&nbsp; Up, Count; you are spokesman.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Exalted Prince,<br />Whose peerless
knighthood, like the remeant sun,<br />After too long a night, regilds
our clay,<br />Late silvered by the reflex lunar beams<br />Of your
celestial lady&rsquo;s matron graces&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i> [aside].&nbsp; Ut vinum optimum amati mei<br />Dulciter
descendens!</p>
<p><i>3</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Think not we mean to praise or disapprove&mdash;<br />The
acts of saintly souls must only plead<br />In foro conscienti&aelig;:
grosser minds,<br />Whose humbler aim is but the public weal,<br />Know
of no mesh which holds them: yet, great Prince,<br />Some dare not see
their sovereign&rsquo;s strength postponed<br />To private grace, and
sigh, that generous hearts,<br />And ladies&rsquo; tenderness, too oft
forgetting<br />That wisdom is the highest charity,<br />Will interfere,
in pardonable haste,<br />With heaven&rsquo;s stern providence.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; We see your drift.<br />Go, sirrah [to a Page];
pray the Princess to illumine<br />Our conclave with her beauties.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis our manner<br />To hear no cause, of gentle or of simple,<br />Unless
the accused and the accuser both<br />Meet face to face.</p>
<p><i>3d</i> <i>Count</i>.&nbsp; Excuse, high-mightiness,&mdash;<br />We
bring no accusation; facts, your Highness,<br />Wait for your sentence,
not our pr&aelig;judicium.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Give us the facts, then, Sir; in the lady&rsquo;s
presence,<br />Her nearness to ourselves&mdash;perchance her reasons&mdash;<br />May
make them somewhat dazzling.</p>
<p><i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Nay, my Lord;<br />I, as a Churchman, though
with these your nobles<br />Both in commission and opinion one,<br />Am
yet most loth, my Lord, to set my seal<br />To aught which this harsh
world might call complaint<br />Against a princely saint&mdash;a chosen
vessel&mdash;<br />An argosy celestial&mdash;in whom error<br />Is but
the young luxuriance of her grace.<br />The Count of Varila, as bound
to neither,<br />For both shall speak, and all which late has passed<br />Upon
the matter of this famine open.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why, if I must speak out&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll
confess<br />To have stood by, and seen the Landgravine<br />Do most
strange deeds; and in her generation<br />Show no more wit than other
babes of light.<br />First, she has given away, to starving rascals,<br />The
stores of grain she might have sold, good lack!<br />For any price she
asked; has pawned your jewels,<br />And mortgaged sundry farms, and
all for food.<br />Has sunk vast sums in fever-hospitals,<br />For rogues
whom famine sickened&mdash;almshouses<br />For sluts whose husbands
died&mdash;schools for their brats.<br />Most sad vagaries! but there&rsquo;s
worse to come.<br />The dulness of the Court has ruined trade:<br />The
jewellers and clothiers don&rsquo;t come near us;<br />The sempstresses,
my lord, and pastrycooks<br />Have quite forgot their craft; she has
turned all heads<br />And made the ladies starve, and wear old clothes,<br />And
run about with her to nurse the sick,<br />Instead of putting gold in
circulation<br />By balls, sham-fights, and dinners; &rsquo;tis most
sad, sir,<br />But she has swept your treasury out as clean&mdash;<br />As
was the widow&rsquo;s cruse, who fed Elijah.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ruined, no doubt!&nbsp; Lo! here the culprit
comes.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth enters.]</p>
<p>Come hither, dearest.&nbsp; These, my knights and nobles,<br />Lament
your late unthrift (your conscience speaks<br />The causes of their
blame); and wish you warned,<br />As wisdom is the highest charity,<br />No
more to interfere, from private feeling,<br />With heaven&rsquo;s stern
laws, or maim the sovereign&rsquo;s wealth,<br />To save superfluous
villains&rsquo; worthless lives.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Lewis!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Not I, fair, but my counsellors,<br />In courtesy,
need some reply.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; My Lords;<br />Doubtless, you speak as your duty
bids you:<br />I know you love my husband: do you think<br />My love
is less than yours?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas for his honour<br />I dare not
lose a single silly sheep<br />Of all the flock which God had trusted
to him.<br />True, I had hoped by this&mdash;No matter what&mdash;<br />Since
to your sense it bears a different hue.<br />I keep no logic.&nbsp;
For my gifts, thank God,<br />They cannot be recalled; for those poor
souls,<br />My pensioners&mdash;even for my husband&rsquo;s knightly
name,<br />Oh! ask not back that slender loan of comfort<br />My folly
has procured them: if, my Lords,<br />My public censure, or disgraceful
penance<br />May expiate, and yet confirm my waste,<br />I offer this
poor body to the buffets<br />Of sternest justice: when I dared not
spare<br />My husband&rsquo;s lands, I dare not spare myself.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; No! no!&nbsp; My noble sister?&nbsp; What? my
Lords!<br />If her love move you not, her wisdom may.<br />She knows
a deeper statecraft, Sirs, than you:<br />She will not throw away the
substance, Abbot,<br />To save the accident; waste living souls<br />To
keep, or hope to keep, the means of life.<br />Our wisdom and our swords
may fill our coffers,<br />But will they breed us men, my Lords, or
mothers?<br />God blesses in the camp a noble rashness:<br />Then why
not in the storehouse?&nbsp; He that lends<br />To Him, need never fear
to lose his venture.<br />Spend on, my Queen.&nbsp; You will not sell
my castles?<br />Nay, you must leave us Neuburg, love, and Wartburg.<br />Their
worn old stones will hardly pay the carriage,<br />And foreign foes
may pay untimely visits.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; And home foes, too; if these philosophers<br />Put
up the curb, my Lord, a half-link tighter,<br />The scythes will be
among our horses&rsquo; legs<br />Before next harvest.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Fear not for our welfare:<br />We have a guardian
here, well skilled to keep<br />Peace for our seneschal, while angels,
stooping<br />To catch the tears she sheds for us in absence,<br />Will
sain us from the roaming adversary<br />With scents of Paradise.&nbsp;
Farewell, my Lords.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Nay,&mdash;I must pray your knighthoods&mdash;You
must honour<br />Our dais and bower as private guests to-day.<br />Thanks
for your gentle warning; may my weakness<br />To such a sin be never
tempted more!</p>
<p>[Exeunt Elizabeth and Lewis.]</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Thus, as if virtue were not its own reward,
is it paid over and above with beef and ale?&nbsp; Weep not, tender-hearted
Count!&nbsp; Though &lsquo;generous hearts,&rsquo; my Lord, &lsquo;and
ladies&rsquo; tenderness, too oft forget&rsquo;&mdash;Truly spoken!&nbsp;
Lord Abbot, does not your spiritual eye discern coals of fire on Count
Hugo&rsquo;s head?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; Where, and a plague?&nbsp; Where?</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i>.&nbsp; Nay, I speak mystically,&mdash;there
is nought there but what beer will quench before nightfall.&nbsp; Here,
peeping rabbit [to a Page at the door], out of your burrow, and show
these gentles to their lodgings.&nbsp; We will meet at the gratias.&nbsp;
[They go out.]</p>
<p><i>C</i>. <i>Wal</i> [alone].&nbsp; Well:&mdash;if Hugo is a brute,
he at least makes no secret of it.&nbsp; He is an old boar, and honest;
he wears his tushes outside, for a warning to all men.&nbsp; But for
the rest!&mdash;Whited sepulchres! and not one of them but has half
persuaded himself of his own benevolence.&nbsp; Of all cruelties, save
me from your small pedant,&mdash;your closet philosopher, who has just
courage enough to bestride his theory, without wit to see whither it
will carry him.&nbsp; In experience, a child: in obstinacy, a woman:
in nothing a man, but in logic-chopping: instead of God&rsquo;s grace,
a few schoolboy saws about benevolence, and industry, and independence&mdash;there
is his metal.&nbsp; If the world will be mended on his principles, well.&nbsp;
If not, poor world!&mdash;but principles must be carried out, though
through blood and famine: for truly, man was made for theories, not
theories for man.&nbsp; A doctrine is these men&rsquo;s God&mdash;touch
but that shrine, and lo! your simpering philanthropist becomes as ruthless
as a Dominican.&nbsp; [Exit.]</p>

<h3>SCENE IX</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s bower.&nbsp; Elizabeth and Lewis sitting together.</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh that we two were Maying<br />Down the stream
of the soft spring breeze;<br />Like children with violets playing<br />In
the shade of the whispering trees!</p>
<p>Oh that we two sat dreaming<br />On the sward of some sheep-trimmed
down<br />Watching the white mist steaming<br />Over river and mead
and town!</p>
<p>Oh that we two lay sleeping<br />In our nest in the churchyard sod,<br />With
our limbs at rest on the quiet earth&rsquo;s breast,<br />And our souls
at home with God!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ah, turn away those swarthy diamonds&rsquo; blaze!<br />Mine
eyes are dizzy, and my faint sense reels<br />In the rich fragrance
of those purple tresses.<br />Oh, to be thus, and thus, day after day!<br />To
sleep, and wake, and find it yet no dream&mdash;<br />My atmosphere,
my hourly food, such bliss<br />As to have dreamt of, five short years
agone,<br />Had seemed a mad conceit.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Five years agone?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; I know not; for upon our marriage-day<br />I
slipped from time into eternity;<br />Where each day teems with centuries
of life,<br />And centuries were but one wedding morn.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Lewis, I am too happy! floating higher<br />Than
e&rsquo;er my will had dared to soar, though able;<br />But circumstance,
which is the will of God,<br />Beguiled my cowardice to that, which,
darling,<br />I found most natural, when I feared it most.<br />Love
would have had no strangeness in mine eyes,<br />Save from the prejudice
which others taught me&mdash;<br />They should know best.&nbsp; Yet
now this wedlock seems<br />A second infancy&rsquo;s baptismal robe,<br />A
heaven, my spirit&rsquo;s antenatal home,<br />Lost in blind pining
girlhood&mdash;found now, found!<br />[Aside]&nbsp; What have I said?&nbsp;
Do I blaspheme?&nbsp; Alas!<br />I neither made these thoughts, nor
can unmake them.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ay, marriage is the life-long miracle,<br />The
self-begetting wonder, daily fresh;<br />The Eden, where the spirit
and the flesh<br />Are one again, and new-born souls walk free,<br />And
name in mystic language all things new,<br />Naked, and not ashamed.&nbsp;
[Eliz. hides her face.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O God! were that true!</p>
<p>[Clasps him round the neck.]</p>
<p>There, there, no more&mdash;<br />I love thee, and I love thee, and
I love thee&mdash;<br />More than rich thoughts can dream, or mad lips
speak;<br />But how, or why, whether with soul or body,<br />I will
not know.&nbsp; Thou art mine.&mdash;Why question further?<br />[Aside]
Ay if I fall by loving, I will love,<br />And be degraded!&mdash;how?
by my own troth-plight?<br />No, but my thinking that I fall.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis
written<br />That whatsoe&rsquo;er is not of faith is sin.&mdash;<br />O
Jesu Lord!&nbsp; Hast Thou not made me thus?<br />Mercy!&nbsp; My brain
will burst: I cannot leave him!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Beloved, if I went away to war&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; More wars?&nbsp; More partings?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Nay, my sister&mdash;<br />My trust but longs
to glory in its surety:<br />What would&rsquo;st thou do?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What I have done already.<br />Have I not followed
thee, through drought and frost,<br />Through flooded swamps, rough
glens, and wasted lands,<br />Even while I panted most with thy dear
loan<br />Of double life?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; My saint! but what if I bid thee<br />To be my
seneschal, and here with prayers,<br />With sober thrift, and noble
bounty shine,<br />Alone and peerless?&nbsp; And suppose&mdash;nay,
start not&mdash;<br />I only said suppose&mdash;the war was long,<br />Our
camps far off, and that some winter, love,<br />Or two, pent back this
Eden stream, where now<br />Joys upon joys like sunlit ripples pass,<br />Alike,
yet ever new.&mdash;What would&rsquo;st thou do, love?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; A year?&nbsp; A year!&nbsp; A cold, blank, widowed
year!<br />Strange, that mere words should chill my heart with fear&mdash;<br />This
is no hall of doom,<br />No impious Soldan&rsquo;s feast of old,<br />Where
o&rsquo;er the madness of the foaming gold,<br />A fleshless hand its
woe on tainted walls enrolled.<br />Yet by thy wild words raised,<br />In
Love&rsquo;s most careless revel,<br />Looms through the future&rsquo;s
fog a shade of evil,<br />And all my heart is glazed.&mdash;<br />Alas!&nbsp;
What would I do?<br />I would lie down and weep, and weep,<br />Till
the salt current of my tears should sweep<br />My soul, like floating
weed, adown a fitful sleep,<br />A lingering half-night through.<br />Then
when the mocking bells did wake<br />My hollow eyes to twilight gray,<br />I
would address my spiritless limbs to pray,<br />And nerve myself with
stripes to meet the weary day,<br />And labour for thy sake.<br />Until
by vigils, fasts, and tears,<br />The flesh was grown so spare and light,<br />That
I could slip its mesh, and flit by night<br />O&rsquo;er sleeping sea
and land to thee&mdash;or Christ&mdash;till morning light.<br />Peace!&nbsp;
Why these fears?<br />Life is too short for mean anxieties:<br />Soul!
thou must work, though blindfold.<br />Come, beloved,<br />I must turn
robber.&mdash;I have begged of late<br />So soft, I fear to ask.&mdash;Give
me thy purse.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; No, not my purse:&mdash;stay&mdash;Where is all
that gold<br />I gave you, when the Jews came here from K&ouml;ln?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, those few coins?&nbsp; I spent them all next
day<br />On a new chapel on the Eisenthal;<br />There were no choristers
but nightingales&mdash;<br />No teachers there save bees: how long is
this?<br />Have you turned niggard?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Nay; go ask my steward&mdash;<br />Take what
you will&mdash;this purse I want myself.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah! now I guess.&nbsp; You have some trinket for
me&mdash;<br />You promised late to buy no more such baubles&mdash;<br />And
now you are ashamed.&mdash;Nay, I must see&mdash;</p>
<p>[Snatches his purse.&nbsp; Lewis hides his face.]</p>
<p>Ah, God! what&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; A new crusader&rsquo;s cross?<br />Whose?&nbsp;
Nay, nay&mdash;turn not from me; I guess all&mdash;<br />You need not
tell me; it is very well&mdash;<br />According to the meed of my deserts:<br />Yes&mdash;very
well.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Ah, love!&mdash;look not so calm&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Fear not&mdash;I shall weep soon.<br />How long
is it since you vowed?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; A week or more.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Brave heart!&nbsp; And all that time your tenderness<br />Kept
silence, knowing my weak foolish soul.&nbsp; [Weeps.]<br />O love!&nbsp;
O life!&nbsp; Late found, and soon, soon lost!<br />A bleak sunrise,&mdash;a
treacherous morning gleam,&mdash;<br />And now, ere mid-day, all my
sky is black<br />With whirling drifts once more!&nbsp; The march is
fixed<br />For this day month, is&rsquo;t not?</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Alas, too true!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh break not, heart!</p>
<p>[Conrad enters.]</p>
<p>Ah! here my master comes.<br />No weeping before him.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Speak to the holy man:<br />He can give strength
and comfort, which poor I<br />Need even more than you.&nbsp; Here,
saintly master,<br />I leave her to your holy eloquence.&nbsp; Farewell!<br />God
help us both!&nbsp; [Exit Lewis.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i> [rising].&nbsp; You know, Sir, that my husband has taken
the cross!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; I do; all praise to God!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; But none to you:<br />Hard-hearted!&nbsp; Am I
not enough your slave?<br />Can I obey you more when he is gone<br />Than
now I do?&nbsp; Wherein, pray, has he hindered<br />This holiness of
mine, for which you make me<br />Old ere my womanhood?&nbsp; [Conrad
offers to go.]<br />Stay, Sir, and tell me<br />Is this the outcome
of your &lsquo;father&rsquo;s care&rsquo;?<br />Was it not enough to
poison all my joys<br />With foulest scruples?&mdash;show me nameless
sins,<br />Where I, unconscious babe, blessed God for all things,<br />But
you must thus intrigue away my knight<br />And plunge me down this gulf
of widowhood!<br />And I not twenty yet&mdash;a girl&mdash;an orphan&mdash;<br />That
cannot stand alone!&nbsp; Was I too happy?<br />O God! what lawful bliss
do I not buy<br />And balance with the smart of some sharp penance?<br />Hast
thou no pity?&nbsp; None?&nbsp; Thou drivest me<br />To fiendish doubts:
Thou, Jesus&rsquo; messenger?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; This to your master!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; This to any one<br />Who dares to part me from
my love.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well&mdash;<br />In pity to your weakness
I must deign<br />To do what ne&rsquo;er I did&mdash;excuse myself.<br />I
say, I knew not of your husband&rsquo;s purpose;<br />God&rsquo;s spirit,
not I, moved him: perhaps I sinned<br />In that I did not urge it myself.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Thou traitor!<br />So thou would&rsquo;st part
us?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Aught that makes thee greater<br />I&rsquo;ll dare.&nbsp;
This very outburst proves in thee<br />Passions unsanctified, and carnal
leanings<br />Upon the creatures thou would&rsquo;st fain transcend.<br />Thou
badest me cure thy weakness.&nbsp; Lo, God brings thee<br />The tonic
cup I feared to mix:&mdash;be brave&mdash;<br />Drink it to the lees,
and thou shalt find within<br />A pearl of price.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis bitter!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Bitter, truly:<br />Even I, to whom the storm of
earthly love<br />Is but a dim remembrance&mdash;Courage!&nbsp; Courage!<br />There&rsquo;s
glory in&rsquo;t; fulfil thy sacrifice;<br />Give up thy noblest on
the noblest service<br />God&rsquo;s sun has looked on, since the chosen
twelve<br />Went conquering, and to conquer, forth.&nbsp; If he fall&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, spare mine ears!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; He falls a blessed martyr,<br />To bid thee welcome
through the gates of pearl;<br />And next to his shall thine own guerdon
be<br />If thou devote him willing to thy God.<br />Wilt thou?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Have mercy!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Wilt thou?&nbsp; Sit not thus<br />Watching the
sightless air: no angel in it<br />But asks thee what I ask: the fiend
alone<br />Delays thy coward flesh.&nbsp; Wilt thou devote him?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I will devote him;&mdash;a crusader&rsquo;s wife!<br />I&rsquo;ll
glory in it.&nbsp; Thou speakest words from God&mdash;<br />And God
shall have him!&nbsp; Go now&mdash;good my master;<br />My poor brain
swims.&nbsp; [Exit Conrad.]<br />Yes&mdash;a crusader&rsquo;s wife!<br />And
a crusader&rsquo;s widow!</p>
<p>[Bursts into tears, and dashes herself on the floor.]</p>

<h3>SCENE X</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A street in the town of Schmalcald.&nbsp; Bodies of Crusading troops
defiling past.&nbsp; Lewis and Elizabeth with their suite in the foreground.</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; Alas! the time is near; I must be gone&mdash;<br />There
are our liegemen; how you&rsquo;ll welcome us,<br />Returned in triumph,
bowed with paynim spoils,<br />Beneath the victor cross, to part no
more!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;we shall part no more, where next we
meet.<br />Enough to have stood here once on such an errand!</p>
<p><i>Lewis</i>.&nbsp; The bugle calls.&mdash;Farewell, my love, my
lady,<br />Queen, sister, saint!&nbsp; One last long kiss&mdash;Farewell!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; One kiss&mdash;and then another&mdash;and another&mdash;<br />Till
&rsquo;tis too late to go&mdash;and so return&mdash;<br />O God! forgive
that craven thought!&nbsp; There, take him<br />Since Thou dost need
him.&nbsp; I have kept him ever<br />Thine, when most mine; and shall
I now deny Thee?<br />Oh! go&mdash;yes, go&mdash;Thou&rsquo;lt not forget
to pray,</p>
<p>[Lewis goes.]</p>
<p>With me, at our old hour?&nbsp; Alas! he&rsquo;s gone<br />And lost&mdash;thank
God he hears me not&mdash;for ever.<br />Why look&rsquo;st thou so,
poor girl?&nbsp; I say, for ever.<br />The day I found the bitter blessed
cross,<br />Something did strike my heart like keen cold steel,<br />Which
quarries daily there with dead dull pains&mdash;<br />Whereby I know
that we shall meet no more.<br />Come!&nbsp; Home, maids, home!&nbsp;
Prepare me widow&rsquo;s weeds&mdash;<br />For he is dead to me, and
I must soon<br />Die too to him, and many things; and mark me&mdash;<br />Breathe
not his name, lest this love-pampered heart<br />Should sicken to vain
yearnings&mdash;Lost! lost! lost!</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; Oh stay, and watch this pomp.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Well said&mdash;we&rsquo;ll stay; so this bright
enterprise<br />Shall blanch our private clouds, and steep our soul<br />Drunk
with the spirit of great Christendom.</p>
<p>CRUSADER CHORUS.</p>
<p>[Men-at-Arms pass, singing.]</p>
<p>The tomb of God before us,<br />Our fatherland behind,<br />Our ships
shall leap o&rsquo;er billows steep,<br />Before a charmed wind.</p>
<p>Above our van great angels<br />Shall fight along the sky;<br />While
martyrs pure and crowned saints<br />To God for rescue cry.</p>
<p>The red-cross knights and yeomen<br />Throughout the holy town,<br />In
faith and might, on left and right,<br />Shall tread the paynim down.</p>
<p>Till on the Mount Moriah<br />The Pope of Rome shall stand;<br />The
Kaiser and the King of France<br />Shall guard him on each hand.</p>
<p>There shall he rule all nations,<br />With crozier and with sword;<br />And
pour on all the heathen<br />The wrath of Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>[Women&mdash;bystanders.]</p>
<p>Christ is a rock in the bare salt land,<br />To shelter our knights
from the sun and sand:<br />Christ the Lord is a summer sun,<br />To
ripen the grain while they are gone.</p>
<p>Then you who fight in the bare salt land,<br />And you who work at
home,<br />Fight and work for Christ the Lord,<br />Until His kingdom
come.</p>
<p>[Old Knights pass.]</p>
<p>Our stormy sun is sinking;<br />Our sands are running low;<br />In
one fair fight, before the night,<br />Our hard-worn hearts shall glow.</p>
<p>We cannot pine in cloister;<br />We cannot fast and pray;<br />The
sword which built our load of guilt<br />Must wipe that guilt away.</p>
<p>We know the doom before us;<br />The dangers of the road;<br />Have
mercy, mercy, Jesu blest,<br />When we lie low in blood.</p>
<p>When we lie gashed and gory,<br />The holy walls within,<br />Sweet
Jesu, think upon our end,<br />And wipe away our sin.</p>
<p>[Boy Crusaders pass.]</p>
<p>The Christ-child sits on high:<br />He looks through the merry blue
sky;<br />He holds in His hand a bright lily-band,<br />For the boys
who for Him die.</p>
<p>On holy Mary&rsquo;s arm,<br />Wrapt safe from terror and harm,<br />Lulled
by the breeze in the paradise trees,<br />Their souls sleep soft and
warm.</p>
<p>Knight David, young and true,<br />The giant Soldan slew,<br />And
our arms so light, for the Christ-child&rsquo;s right,<br />Like noble
deeds can do.</p>
<p>[Young Knights pass.]</p>
<p>The rich East blooms fragrant before us;<br />All Fairyland beckons
us forth;<br />We must follow the crane in her flight o&rsquo;er the
main,<br />From the frosts and the moors of the North.</p>
<p>Our sires in the youth of the nations<br />Swept westward through
plunder and blood,<br />But a holier quest calls us back to the East,<br />We
fight for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Then shrink not, and sigh not, fair ladies,<br />The red cross which
flames on each arm and each shield,<br />Through philtre and spell,
and the black charms of hell,<br />Shall shelter our true love in camp
and in field.</p>
<p>[Old Monk, looking after them.]</p>
<p>Jerusalem, Jerusalem!<br />The burying place of God!<br />Why gay
and bold, in steel and gold,<br />O&rsquo;er the paths where Christ
hath trod?</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE I</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A chamber in the Wartburg.&nbsp; Elizabeth sitting in widow&rsquo;s
weeds; Guta and Isentrudis by her.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Always thus, my Princess?&nbsp; Is
this wise,<br />By day with fasts and ceaseless coil of labour;<br />About
the ungracious poor&mdash;hands, eyes, feet, brain<br />O&rsquo;ertasked
alike&mdash;&rsquo;mid sin and filth, which make<br />Each sense a plague&mdash;by
night with cruel stripes,<br />And weary watchings on the freezing stone,<br />To
double all your griefs, and burn life&rsquo;s candle,<br />As village
gossips say, at either end?<br />The good book bids the heavy-hearted
drink,<br />And so forget their woe.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis written too<br />In that same book,
nurse, that the days shall come<br />When the bridegroom shall be taken
away&mdash;and then&mdash;<br />Then shall they mourn and fast: I needed
weaning<br />From sense and earthly joys; by this way only<br />May
I win God to leave in mine own hands<br />My luxury&rsquo;s cure: oh!&nbsp;
I may bring him back,<br />By working out to its full depth the chastening<br />The
need of which his loss proves: I but barter<br />Less grief for greater&mdash;pain
for widowhood.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; And death for life&mdash;your cheeks are wan and
sharp<br />As any three-days&rsquo; moon&mdash;you are shifting always<br />Uneasily
and stiff, now, on your seat,<br />As from some secret pain.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Why watch me thus?<br />You cannot know&mdash;and
yet you know too much&mdash;<br />I tell you, nurse, pain&rsquo;s comfort,
when the flesh<br />Aches with the aching soul in harmony,<br />And
even in woe, we are one: the heart must speak<br />Its passion&rsquo;s
strangeness in strange symbols out,<br />Or boil, till it bursts inly.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Yet, methinks,<br />You might have made this widowed
solitude<br />A holy rest&mdash;a spell of soft gray weather,<br />Beneath
whose fragrant dews all tender thoughts<br />Might bud and burgeon.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a gentle dream;<br />But nature shows
nought like it: every winter,<br />When the great sun has turned his
face away,<br />The earth goes down into the vale of grief,<br />And
fasts, and weeps, and shrouds herself in sables,<br />Leaving her wedding-garlands
to decay&mdash;<br />Then leaps in spring to his returning kisses&mdash;<br />As
I may yet!&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; There, now&mdash;my foolish child!<br />You faint:
come&mdash;come to your chamber&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, forgive me!<br />But hope at times throngs
in so rich and full,<br />It mads the brain like wine: come with me,
nurse,<br />Sit by me, lull me calm with gentle tales<br />Of noble
ladies wandering in the wild wood,<br />Fed on chance earth-nuts, and
wild strawberries,<br />Or milk of silly sheep, and woodland doe.<br />Or
how fair Magdalen &rsquo;mid desert sands<br />Wore out in prayer her
lonely blissful years,<br />Watched by bright angels, till her modest
tresses<br />Wove to her pearled feet their golden shroud.<br />Come,
open all your lore.</p>
<p>[Sophia and Agnes enter.]</p>
<p>My mother-in-law!</p>
<p>[Aside] Shame on thee, heart! why sink, whene&rsquo;er we meet?</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Daughter, we know of old thy strength, of metal<br />Beyond
us worldlings: shrink not, if the time<br />Be come which needs its
use&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What means this preface?&nbsp; Ah! your looks
are big<br />With sudden woes&mdash;speak out.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Be calm, and hear<br />The will of God toward
my son, thy husband.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What? is he captive?&nbsp; Why then&mdash;what
of that?<br />There are friends will rescue him&mdash;there&rsquo;s
gold for ransom&mdash;<br />We&rsquo;ll sell our castles&mdash;live
in bowers of rushes&mdash;<br />O God! that I were with him in the dungeon!</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; He is not taken.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; No! he would have fought to the death!<br />There&rsquo;s
treachery!&nbsp; What paynim dog dare face<br />His lance, who naked
braved yon lion&rsquo;s rage,<br />And eyed the cowering monster to
his den?<br />Speak!&nbsp; Has he fled? or worse?</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Child, he is dead.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i> [clasping her hands on her knees.].&nbsp; The world is
dead to me, and all its smiles!</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Oh, woe! my Prince! and doubly woe, my daughter<i>.</i></p>
<p>[Elizabeth springs up and rushes out.]</p>
<p>Oh, stop her&mdash;stop my child!&nbsp; She will go mad&mdash;<br />Dash
herself down&mdash;Fly&mdash;Fly&mdash;She is not made<br />Of hard,
light stuff, like you.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; I had expected some such passionate outbreak<br />At
the first news: you see now, Lady Agnes,<br />These saints, who fain
would &lsquo;wean themselves from earth,&rsquo;<br />Still yield to
the affections they despise<br />When the game&rsquo;s earnest&mdash;Now&mdash;ere
they return&mdash;<br />Your brother, child, is dead&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Agnes</i>.&nbsp; I know it too well.<br />So young&mdash;so brave&mdash;so
blest!&mdash;And she&mdash;she loved him&mdash;<br />Oh!&nbsp; I repent
of all the foolish scoffs<br />With which I crossed her.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;the Landgrave&rsquo;s dead&mdash;<br />Attend
to me&mdash;Alas! my son! my son!<br />He was my first-born!&nbsp; But
he has a brother&mdash;<br />Agnes! we must not let this foreign gipsy,<br />Who,
as you see, is scarce her own wits&rsquo; mistress,<br />Flaunt sovereign
over us, and our broad lands,<br />To my son&rsquo;s prejudice&mdash;There
are barons, child,<br />Who will obey a knight, but not a saint:<br />I
must at once to them.</p>
<p><i>Agnes</i>.&nbsp; Oh, let me stay.</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; As you shall please&mdash;Your brother&rsquo;s
landgravate<br />Is somewhat to you, surely&mdash;and your smiles<br />Are
worth gold pieces in a court intrigue.<br />For her, on her own principles,
a downfall<br />Is a chastening mercy&mdash;and a likely one.</p>
<p><i>Agnes</i>.&nbsp; Oh! let me stay, and comfort her!</p>
<p><i>Soph</i>.&nbsp; Romance!<br />You girls adore a scene&mdash;as
lookers on.</p>
<p>[Exit Sophia.]</p>
<p><i>Agnes</i> [alone].&nbsp; Well spoke the old monks, peaceful watching
life&rsquo;s turmoil,<br />&lsquo;Eyes which look heavenward, weeping
still we see:<br />God&rsquo;s love with keen flame purges, like the
lightning flash,<br />Gold which is purest, purer still must be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>[Guta enters.]</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; Returned alone!&nbsp; Where has my sister been?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Thank heaven you hear alone, for such sad sight
would haunt<br />Henceforth your young hopes&mdash;crush your shuddering
fancy down<br />With dread of like fierce anguish.<br />You saw her
bound forth: we towards her bower in haste<br />Ran trembling: spell-bound
there, before her bridal-bed<br />She stood, while wan smiles flickered,
like the northern dawn,<br />Across her worn cheeks&rsquo; ice-field;
keenest memories then<br />Rushed with strong shudderings through her&mdash;as
the winged shaft<br />Springs from the tense nerve, so her passion hurled
her forth<br />Sweeping, like fierce ghost, on through hall and corridor,<br />Tearless,
with wide eyes staring, while a ghastly wind<br />Moaned on through
roof and rafter, and the empty helms<br />Along the walls ran clattering,
and above her waved<br />Dead heroes&rsquo; banners; swift and yet more
swift she drove<br />Still seeking aimless; sheer against the opposing
wall<br />At last dashed reckless&mdash;there with frantic fingers clutched<br />Blindly
the ribbed oak, till that frost of rage<br />Dissolved itself in tears,
and like a babe,<br />With inarticulate moans, and folded hands,<br />She
followed those who led her, as if the sun<br />On her life&rsquo;s dial
had gone back seven years,<br />And she were once again the dumb sad
child<br />We knew her ere she married.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i> [entering].&nbsp; As after wolf wolf presses, leaping
through the snow-glades,<br />So woe on woe throngs surging up.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; What? treason?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Treason, and of the foulest.&nbsp; From her state
she&rsquo;s rudely thrust;<br />Her keys are seized; her weeping babies
pent from her:<br />The wenches stop their sobs to sneer askance,<br />And
greet their fallen censor&rsquo;s new mischance.</p>
<p><i>Agnes</i>.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Who dared to do this wrong?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Your mother and your mother&rsquo;s son&mdash;<br />Judge
you, if it was knightly done.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; See! see! she comes, with heaving breast,<br />With
bursting eyes, and purpled brow:<br />Oh that the traitors saw her now!<br />They
know not, sightless fools, the heart they break.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth enters slowly.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; He is in purgatory now!&nbsp; Alas!<br />Angels!
be pitiful! deal gently with him!<br />His sins were gentle!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
one cause left for living&mdash;<br />To pray, and pray for him: why
all these months<br />I prayed,&mdash;and here&rsquo;s my answer: Dead
of a fever!<br />Why thus? so soon!&nbsp; Only six years for love!<br />While
any formal, heartless matrimony,<br />Patched up by Court intrigues,
and threats of cloisters,<br />Drags on for six times six, and peasant
slaves<br />Grow old on the same straw, and hand in hand<br />Slip from
life&rsquo;s oozy bank, to float at ease.</p>
<p>[A knocking at the door.]</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some petitioner.<br />Go to&mdash;I will not hear them:
why should I work,<br />When he is dead?&nbsp; Alas! was that my sin?<br />Was
he, not Christ, my lodestar?&nbsp; Why not warn me?<br />Too late!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s this foul dream?&nbsp; Dead at Otranto&mdash;<br />Parched
by Italian suns&mdash;no woman by him&mdash;<br />He was too chaste!&nbsp;
Nought but rude men to nurse!&mdash;<br />If I had been there, I should
have watched by him&mdash;<br />Guessed every fancy&mdash;God!&nbsp;
I might have saved him!</p>
<p>[A servant-man bursts in.]</p>
<p><i>Servant</i>.&nbsp; Madam, the Landgrave gave me strict commands&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; The Landgrave, dolt?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I might have saved him!</p>
<p><i>Servant</i> [to Isen.]&nbsp; Ay, saucy madam!&mdash;<br />The
Landgrave Henry, lord and master,<br />Freer than the last, and yet
no waster,<br />Who will not stint a poor knave&rsquo;s beer,<br />Or
spin out Lent through half the year.<br />Why&mdash;I see double!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Who spoke there of the Landgrave?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
this drunkard?<br />Give him his answer&mdash;&rsquo;Tis no time for
mumming&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Serv</i>.&nbsp; The Landgrave Henry bade me see you out<br />Safe
through his gates, and that at once, my Lady.<br />Come!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Why&mdash;that&rsquo;s hasty&mdash;I must take
my children<br />Ah!&nbsp; I forgot&mdash;they would not let me see
them.<br />I must pack up my jewels&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Serv</i>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not need it&mdash;<br />His Lordship
has the keys.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; He has indeed.<br />Why, man!&mdash;I am thy children&rsquo;s
godmother&mdash;<br />I nursed thy wife myself in the black sickness&mdash;<br />Art
thou a bird, that when the old tree falls,<br />Flits off, and sings
in the sapling?</p>
<p>[The man seizes her arm.]</p>
<p>Keep thine hands off&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll not be shamed&mdash;Lead
on.&nbsp; Farewell, my Ladies.<br />Follow not!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
want to spare on earth already;<br />And mine own woe is weight enough
for me.<br />Go back, and say, Elizabeth has yet<br />Eternal homes,
built deep in poor men&rsquo;s hearts;<br />And, in the alleys underneath
the wall,<br />Has bought with sinful mammon heavenly treasure,<br />More
sure than adamant, purer than white whales&rsquo; bone,<br />Which now
she claims.&nbsp; Lead on: a people&rsquo;s love shall right me.&nbsp;
[Exit with Servant.]</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Where now, dame?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Where, but after her?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; True heart!<br />I&rsquo;ll follow to the death.&nbsp;
[Exeunt.]</p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A street.&nbsp; Elizabeth and Guta at the door of a Convent.&nbsp;
Monks in the porch.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; You are afraid to shelter me&mdash;afraid.<br />And
so you thrust me forth, to starve and freeze.<br />Soon said.&nbsp;
Why palter o&rsquo;er these mean excuses,<br />Which tempt me to despise
you?</p>
<p><i>Monks</i>.&nbsp; Ah! my lady,<br />We know your kindness&mdash;but
we poor religious<br />Are bound to obey God&rsquo;s ordinance, and
submit<br />Unto the powers that be, who have forbidden<br />All men,
alas! to give you food or shelter.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Silence!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; Better in
God&rsquo;s hand than man&rsquo;s.<br />He shall kill us, if we die.&nbsp;
This bitter blast<br />Warping the leafless willows, yon white snow-storms,<br />Whose
wings, like vengeful angels, cope the vault,<br />They are God&rsquo;s,&mdash;We&rsquo;ll
trust to them.</p>
<p>[Monks go in.]</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Mean-spirited!<br />Fair frocks hide foul hearts.&nbsp;
Why, their altar now<br />Is blazing with your gifts.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; How long their altar?<br />To God I gave&mdash;and
God shall pay me back.<br />Fool! to have put my trust in living man,<br />And
fancied that I bought God&rsquo;s love, by buying<br />The greedy thanks
of these His earthly tools!<br />Well&mdash;here&rsquo;s one lesson
learnt!&nbsp; I thank thee, Lord!<br />Henceforth I&rsquo;ll straight
to Thee, and to Thy poor.<br />What?&nbsp; Isentrudis not returned?&nbsp;
Alas!<br />Where are those children?<br />They will not have the heart
to keep them from me&mdash;<br />Oh! have the traitors harmed them?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Do not think it.<br />The dowager has a woman&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ay, ay&mdash;<br />But she&rsquo;s a mother&mdash;and
mothers will dare all things&mdash;<br />Oh!&nbsp; Love can make us
fiends, as well as angels.<br />My babies!&nbsp; Weeping?&nbsp; Oh,
have mercy, Lord!<br />On me heap all thy wrath&mdash;I understand it:<br />What
can blind senseless terror do for them?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Plead, plead your penances!&nbsp; Great God, consider<br />All
she has done and suffered, and forbear<br />To smite her like a worldling!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Silence, girl!<br />I&rsquo;d plead my deeds,
if mine own character,<br />My strength of will had fathered them: but
no&mdash;<br />They are His, who worked them in me, in despite<br />Of
mine own selfish and luxurious will&mdash;<br />Shall I bribe Him with
His own?&nbsp; For pain, I tell thee<br />I need more pain than mine
own will inflicts,<br />Pain which shall break that will.&mdash;Yet
spare them, Lord!<br />Go to&mdash;I am a fool to wish them life&mdash;<br />And
greater fool to miscall life, this headache&mdash;<br />This nightmare
of our gross and crude digestion&mdash;<br />This fog which steams up
from our freezing clay&mdash;<br />While waking heaven&rsquo;s beyond.&nbsp;
No! slay them, traitors!<br />Cut through the channels of those innocent
breaths<br />Whose music charmed my lone nights, ere they learn<br />To
love the world, and hate the wretch who bore them!</p>
<p>[Weeps.]</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; This storm will blind us both: come here, and
shield you<br />Behind this buttress.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a wind to me?<br />I can see up the
street here, if they come&mdash;<br />They do not come!&mdash;Oh! my
poor weanling lambs&mdash;<br />Struck dead by carrion ravens!<br />What
then, I have borne worse.&nbsp; But yesterday<br />I thought I had a
husband&mdash;and now&mdash;now!<br />Guta!&nbsp; He called a holy man
before he died?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; The Bishop of Jerusalem, &rsquo;tis said,<br />With
holy oil, and with the blessed body<br />Of Him for whom he died, did
speed him duly<br />Upon his heavenward flight.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O happy bishop!<br />Where are those children?&nbsp;
If I had but seen him!<br />I could have borne all then.&nbsp; One word&mdash;one
kiss!<br />Hark!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that rushing?&nbsp; White doves&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<br />Fleeing
before the gale.&nbsp; My children&rsquo;s spirits!<br />Stay, babies&mdash;stay
for me!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Not a moment?<br />And I so nearly ready to
be gone?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Still on your children?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! this grief is light<br />And floats a-top&mdash;well,
well; it hides a while<br />That gulf too black for speech&mdash;My
husband&rsquo;s dead!<br />I dare not think on&rsquo;t.<br />A small
bird dead in the snow!&nbsp; Alas! poor minstrel!<br />A week ago, before
this very window,<br />He warbled, may be, to the slanting sunlight;<br />And
housewives blest him for a merry singer:<br />And now he freezes at
their doors, like me.<br />Poor foolish brother! didst thou look for
payment?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; But thou hast light in darkness: he has none&mdash;<br />The
bird&rsquo;s the sport of time, while our life&rsquo;s floor<br />Is
laid upon eternity; no crack in it<br />But shows the underlying heaven.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Art sure?<br />Does this look like it, girl?&nbsp;
No&mdash;I&rsquo;ll trust yet&mdash;<br />Some have gone mad for less;
but why should I?<br />Who live in time, and not eternity.<br />&rsquo;Twill
end, girl, end; no cloud across the sun<br />But passes at the last,
and gives us back<br />The face of God once more.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; See here they come,<br />Dame Isentrudis and your
children, all<br />Safe down the cliff path, through the whirling snow-drifts.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O Lord, my Lord!&nbsp; I thank thee!<br />Loving
and merciful, and tender-hearted,<br />And even in fiercest wrath remembering
mercy.<br />Lo! here&rsquo;s my ancient foe.&nbsp; What want you, Sir?</p>
<p>[Hugo enters.]</p>
<p><i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; Want?&nbsp; Faith, &rsquo;tis you who want, not
I, my Lady&mdash;<br />I hear, you are gone a begging through the town;<br />So,
for your husband&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;ll take you in;<br />For though
I can&rsquo;t forget your scurvy usage,<br />He was a very honest sort
of fellow,<br />Though mad as a March hare; so come you in.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; But know you, Sir, that all my husband&rsquo;s
vassals<br />Are bidden bar their doors to me?</p>
<p><i>Hugo</i>.&nbsp; I know it:<br />And therefore come you in; my
house is mine:<br />No upstarts shall lay down the law to me;<br />Not
they, mass: but mind you, no canting here&mdash;<br />No psalm-singing;
all candles out at eight:<br />Beggars must not be choosers.&nbsp; Come
along!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I thank you, Sir; and for my children&rsquo;s
sake<br />I do accept your bounty. [aside]&nbsp; Down, proud heart&mdash;<br />Bend
lower&mdash;lower ever: thus God deals with thee.<br />Go, Guta, send
the children after me.&nbsp; [Exeunt severally.]</p>
<p>[Two Peasants enter.]</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Father January taken a
lease of March month, and put in Jack Frost for bailiff.&nbsp; What
be I to do for spring-feed if the weather holds,&mdash;and my ryelands
as bare as the back of my hand?</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your luck.&nbsp; Freeze
on, say I, and may Mary Mother send us snow a yard deep.&nbsp; I have
ten ton of hay yet to sell&mdash;ten ton, man&mdash;there&rsquo;s my
luck: every man for himself, and&mdash;Why here comes that handsome
canting girl, used to be about the Princess.</p>
<p>[Guta enters.]</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Well met, fair sirs!&nbsp; I know you kind and
loyal,<br />And bound by many a favour to my mistress:<br />Say, will
you bear this letter for her sake<br />Unto her aunt, the rich and holy
lady<br />Who rules the nuns of Kitzingen?</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; If I do, pickle me in a barrel among
cabbage.<br />She told me once, God&rsquo;s curse would overtake me,<br />For
grinding of the poor: her turn&rsquo;s come now.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Will you, then, help her?&nbsp; She will pay you
richly.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Ay?&nbsp; How, dame?&nbsp; How?&nbsp;
Where will the money come from?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; God knows&mdash;</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; And you do not.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Why, but last winter,<br />When all your stacks
were fired, she lent you gold.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be generous:
as the times are hard,<br />Say, if I take your letter, will you promise<br />To
marry me yourself?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Ay, marry you,<br />Or anything, if you&rsquo;ll
but go to-day:<br />At once, mind.&nbsp; [Giving him the letter.]</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Ay, I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;ll
remember?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Straight to her ladyship at Kitzingen.<br />God
and His saints deal with you, as you deal<br />With us this day.&nbsp;
[Exit.]</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; What! art thou fallen in love promiscuously?</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Why, see, now, man; she has her mistress&rsquo;
ear;<br />And if I marry her, no doubt they&rsquo;ll make me<br />Bailiff,
or land-steward; and there&rsquo;s noble pickings<br />In that same
line.</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Thou hast bought a pig in a poke:<br />Her
priest will shrive her off from such a bargain.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Dost think?&nbsp; Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
not fret myself about it.<br />See, now, before I start, I must get
home<br />Those pigs from off the forest; chop some furze;<br />And
then to get my supper, and my horse&rsquo;s:<br />And then a man will
need to sit a while,<br />And take his snack of brandy for digestion;<br />And
then to fettle up my sword and buckler;<br />And then, bid &rsquo;em
all good-bye: and by that time<br />&rsquo;Twill be &rsquo;most nightfall&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
just go to-morrow.<br />Off&mdash;here she comes again.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>
<p>[Isentrudis and Guta enter, with the children.]</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; I warned you of it; I knew she would not stay<br />An
hour, thus treated like a slave&mdash;an idiot.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twas past bearing: so we are thrust
forth<br />To starve again.&nbsp; Are all your jewels gone?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; All pawned and eaten&mdash;and for her, you know,<br />She
never bore the worth of one day&rsquo;s meal<br />About her dress.&nbsp;
We can but die&mdash;No foe<br />Can ban us from that rest.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Ay, but these children!&mdash;Well&mdash;if it
must be,<br />Here, Guta, pull off this old withered hand<br />My wedding-ring;
the man who gave it me<br />Should be in heaven&mdash;and there he&rsquo;ll
know my heart.<br />Take it, girl, take it.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the
Princess now?<br />She stopped before a crucifix to pray;<br />But why
so long?</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Oh! prayer, to her rapt soul,<br />Is like the
drunkenness of the autumn bee,<br />Who, scent-enchanted, on the latest
flower,<br />Heedless of cold, will linger listless on,<br />And freeze
in odorous dreams.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Ah! here she comes.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Dripping from head to foot with wet and mire!<br />How&rsquo;s
this?</p>
<p>[Elizabeth entering.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Oh, my fortune rises to full flood:<br />I
met a friend just now, who told me truths<br />Wholesome and stern,
of my deceitful heart&mdash;<br />Would God I had known them earlier!&mdash;and
enforced<br />Her lesson so, as I shall ne&rsquo;er forget it<br />In
body or in mind.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; What means all this?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; You know the stepping-stones across the ford.<br />There
as I passed, a certain aged crone,<br />Whom I had fed, and nursed,
year after year,<br />Met me mid-stream&mdash;thrust past me stoutly
on&mdash;<br />And rolled me headlong in the freezing mire.<br />There
as I lay and weltered,&mdash;&lsquo;Take that, Madam,<br />For all your
selfish hypocritic pride<br />Which thought it such a vast humility<br />To
wash us poor folk&rsquo;s feet, and use our bodies<br />For staves to
build withal your Jacob&rsquo;s-ladder.<br />What! you would mount to
heaven upon our backs?<br />The ass has thrown his rider.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She crept on&mdash;<br />I washed my garments in the brook hard by&mdash;<br />And
came here, all the wiser.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Miscreant hag!</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Alas, you&rsquo;ll freeze.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Who could have dreamt the witch<br />Could harbour
such a spite?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Nay, who could dream<br />She would have guessed
my heart so well?&nbsp; Dull boors<br />See deeper than we think, and
hide within<br />Those leathern hulls unfathomable truths,<br />Which
we amid thought&rsquo;s glittering mazes lose.<br />They grind among
the iron facts of life,<br />And have no time for self-deception.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Come&mdash;<br />Put on my cloak&mdash;stand here,
behind the wall.<br />Oh! is it come to this?&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll die
of cold.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; Ungrateful fiend!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Let be&mdash;we must not think on&rsquo;t.<br />The
scoff was true&mdash;I thank her&mdash;I thank God&mdash;<br />This
too I needed.&nbsp; I had built myself<br />A Babel-tower, whose top
should reach to heaven,<br />Of poor men&rsquo;s praise and prayers,
and subtle pride<br />At mine own alms.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis crumbled into
dust!<br />Oh!&nbsp; I have leant upon an arm of flesh&mdash;<br />And
here&rsquo;s its strength!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk by faith&mdash;by faith<br />And
rest my weary heart on Christ alone&mdash;<br />On him, the all-sufficient!<br />Shame
on me! dreaming thus about myself,<br />While you stand shivering here.&nbsp;
[To her little Son.]<br />Art cold, young knight?<br />Knights must
not cry&mdash;Go slide, and warm thyself.<br />Where shall we lodge
to-night?</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no place open,<br />But that foul
tavern, where we lay last night.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth&rsquo;s</i> <i>Son</i> [clinging to her].&nbsp; O mother,
mother! go not to that house&mdash;<br />Among those fierce lank men,
who laughed, and scowled,<br />And showed their knives, and sang strange
ugly songs<br />Of you and us.&nbsp; O mother! let us be!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Hark! look!&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s voice!&mdash;his
very eye&mdash;<br />Opening so slow and sad, then sinking down<br />In
luscious rest again!</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Bethink you, child&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll think&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
to our tavern friends;<br />If they be brutes, &rsquo;twas my sin left
them so.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but for a night or two: three days
will bring<br />The Abbess hither.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; And then to Bamberg straight<br />For knights
and men-at-arms!&nbsp; Your uncle&rsquo;s wrath&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Guta</i> [aside].&nbsp; Hush! hush! you&rsquo;ll fret her, if
you talk of vengeance.</p>
<p><i>Isen</i>.&nbsp; Come to our shelter.</p>
<p><i>Children</i>.&nbsp; Oh stay here, stay here!<br />Behind these
walls.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ay&mdash;stay a while in peace.&nbsp; The storms
are still.<br />Beneath her eider robe the patient earth<br />Watches
in silence for the sun: we&rsquo;ll sit<br />And gaze up with her at
the changeless heaven,<br />Until this tyranny be overpast.<br />Come.

<h3>SCENE III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Chamber in the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace at Bamberg.&nbsp; Elizabeth
and Guta.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; You have determined?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;to go with him.<br />I have kept my
oath too long to break it now.<br />I will to Marpurg, and there waste
away<br />In meditation and in pious deeds,<br />Till God shall set
me free.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; How if your uncle<br />Will have you marry?&nbsp;
Day and night, they say,<br />He talks of nothing else.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Never, girl, never!<br />Save me from that at
least, O God!</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; He spoke<br />Of giving us, your maidens, to his
knights<br />In carnal wedlock: but I fear him not:<br />For God&rsquo;s
own word is pledged to keep me pure&mdash;<br />I am a maid.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; And I, alas! am none!<br />O Guta! dost thou mock
my widowed love?<br />I was a wife&mdash;&rsquo;tis true: I was not
worthy&mdash;<br />But there was meaning in that first wild fancy;<br />&rsquo;Twas
but the innocent springing of the sap&mdash;<br />The witless yearning
of an homeless heart&mdash;<br />Do I not know that God has pardoned
me?<br />But now&mdash;to rouse and turn of mine own will,<br />In cool
and full foreknowledge, this worn soul<br />Again to that, which, when
God thrust it on me,<br />Bred but one shame of ever-gnawing doubt,<br />Were&mdash;No,
my burning cheeks!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll say no more.<br />Ah! loved and
lost!&nbsp; Though God&rsquo;s chaste grace should fail me,<br />My
weak idolatry of thee would give<br />Strength that should keep me true:
with mine own hands<br />I&rsquo;d mar this tear-worn face, till petulant
man<br />Should loathe its scarred and shapeless ugliness.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; But your poor children?&nbsp; What becomes of
them?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! she who was not worthy of a husband<br />Does
not deserve his children.&nbsp; What are they, darlings,<br />But snares
to keep me from my heavenly spouse<br />By picturing the spouse I must
forget?<br />Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis blank horror.&nbsp; Yet if grief&rsquo;s
good for me,<br />Let me down into grief&rsquo;s blackest pit,<br />And
follow out God&rsquo;s cure by mine own deed.</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; What will your kinsfolk think?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What will they think!<br />What pleases them.&nbsp;
That argument&rsquo;s a staff<br />Which breaks whene&rsquo;er you lean
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Trust me, girl,<br />That fear of man sucks out love&rsquo;s
soaring ether,<br />Baffles faith&rsquo;s heavenward eyes, and drops
us down,<br />To float, like plumeless birds, on any stream.<br />Have
I not proved it?<br />There was a time with me, when every eye<br />Did
scorch like flame: if one looked cold on me,<br />I straight accused
myself of mortal sins:<br />Each fopling was my master: I have lied<br />From
very fear of mine own serving-maids.&mdash;<br />That&rsquo;s past,
thank God&rsquo;s good grace!</p>
<p><i>Guta</i>.&nbsp; And now you leap<br />To the other end of the
line.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; In self-defence.<br />I am too weak to live by
half my conscience;<br />I have no wit to weigh and choose the mean;<br />Life
is too short for logic; what I do<br />I must do simply; God alone must
judge&mdash;<br />For God alone shall guide, and God&rsquo;s elect&mdash;<br />I
shrink from earth&rsquo;s chill frosts too much to crawl&mdash;<br />I
have snapped opinion&rsquo;s chains, and now I&rsquo;ll soar<br />Up
to the blazing sunlight, and be free.</p>
<p>[The bishop of Bamberg enters.&nbsp; Conrad following.]</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; The Devil plagued St. Antony in the likeness
of a lean friar!&nbsp; Between mad monks and mad women, bedlam&rsquo;s
broke loose, I think.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; When the Spirit first descended on the elect, seculars
then, too, said mocking, &lsquo;These men are full of new wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Seculars, truly!&nbsp; If I had not in my secularity
picked up a spice of chivalry to the ladies, I should long ago have
turned out you and your regulars, to cant elsewhere.&nbsp; Plague on
this gout&mdash;I must sit.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Let me settle your cushion, uncle.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; So! girl!&nbsp; I sent for you from Botenstain.&nbsp;
I had a mind, now, to have kept you there until your wits returned,
and you would say Yes to some young noble suitor.&nbsp; As if I had
not had trouble enough about your dower!&mdash;If I had had to fight
for it, I should not have minded:&mdash;but these palavers and conferences
have fretted me into the gout: and now you would throw all away again,
tired with your toy, I suppose.&nbsp; What shall I say to the Counts,
Varila, and the Cupbearer, and all the noble knights who will hazard
their lands and lives in trying to right you with that traitor?&nbsp;
I am ashamed to look them in the face!&nbsp; To give all up to the villain!&mdash;To
pay him for his treason!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Uncle, I give but what to me is worthless.&nbsp;
He loves these baubles&mdash;let him keep them, then: I have my dower.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; To squander on nuns and beggars, at this rogue&rsquo;s
bidding?&nbsp; Why not marry some honest man?&nbsp; You may have your
choice of kings and princes; and if you have been happy with one gentleman,
Mass! say I, why can&rsquo;t you be happy with another?&nbsp; What saith
the Scripture?&nbsp; &lsquo;I will that the younger widows marry, bear
children,&rsquo;&mdash;not run after monks, and what not&mdash;What&rsquo;s
good for the filly, is good for the mare, say I.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Uncle, I soar now at a higher pitch&mdash;<br />To
be henceforth the bride of Christ alone.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Ahem!&mdash;a pious notion&mdash;in moderation.&nbsp;
We must be moderate, my child, moderate: I hate overdoing anything&mdash;especially
religion.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Madam, between your uncle and myself<br />This
question in your absence were best mooted.</p>
<p>[Exit Elizabeth.]</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; How, priest? do you order her about like a servant-maid?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The saints forbid!&nbsp; Now&mdash;ere I lose a
moment&mdash;</p>
<p>[Kneeling.]</p>
<p>[Aside] All things to all men be&mdash;and so save some&mdash;<br />[Aloud]
Forgive, your grace, forgive me,<br />If mine unmannered speech in aught
have clashed<br />With your more tempered and melodious judgment:<br />Your
courage will forgive an honest warmth.<br />God knows, I serve no private
interests.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Your order&rsquo;s, hey? to wit?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; My lord, my lord,<br />There may be higher aims:
but what I said,<br />I said but for our Church, and our cloth&rsquo;s
honour.<br />Ladies&rsquo; religion, like their love, we know,<br />Requires
a gloss of verbal exaltation,<br />Lest the sweet souls should understand
themselves;<br />And clergymen must talk up to the mark.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; We all know, Gospel preached in the mother-tongue<br />Sounds
too like common sense.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Or too unlike it:<br />You know the world, your
grace; you know the sex&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Ahem!&nbsp; As a spectator.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Philosophic&egrave;&mdash;<br />Just so&mdash;You
know their rage for shaven crowns&mdash;<br />How they&rsquo;ll deny
their God&mdash;but not their priest&mdash;<br />Flirts&mdash;scandal-mongers&mdash;in
default of both come<br />Platonic love&mdash;worship of art and genius&mdash;<br />Idols
which make them dream of heaven, as girls<br />Dream of their sweethearts,
when they sleep on bridecake.<br />It saves from worse&mdash;we are
not all Abelards.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i> [aside].&nbsp; Some of us have his tongue, if not his
face.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; There lies her fancy; do but balk her of it&mdash;<br />She&rsquo;ll
bolt to cloisters, like a rabbit scared.<br />Head her from that&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
wed some pink-faced boy&mdash;<br />The more low-bred and penniless,
the likelier.<br />Send her to Marpurg, and her brain will cool.<br />Tug
at the kite, &rsquo;twill only soar the higher:<br />Give it but line,
my lord, &rsquo;twill drop like slate.<br />Use but that eagle&rsquo;s
glance, whose daring foresight<br />In chapter, camp, and council, wins
the wonder<br />Of timid trucklers&mdash;Scan results and outcomes&mdash;<br />The
scale is heavy in your grace&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Bah! priest!&nbsp; What can this Marpurg-madness
do for me?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Leave you the tutelage of all her children.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Thank you&mdash;to play the dry-nurse to three
starving brats.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The minor&rsquo;s guardian guards the minor&rsquo;s
lands.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Unless they are pitched away in building hospitals.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Instead of fattening in your wisdom&rsquo;s keeping.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Well, well,&mdash;but what gross scandal to
the family!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The family, my lord, would gain a saint.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Ah! monk, that canonisation costs a frightful
sum.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; These fees, just now, would gladly be remitted.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; These are the last days, faith, when Rome&rsquo;s
too rich to take!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The Saints forbid, my lord, the fisher&rsquo;s
see<br />Were so o&rsquo;ercursed by Mammon!&nbsp; But you grieve,<br />I
know, to see foul weeds of heresy<br />Of late o&rsquo;errun your diocese.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Ay, curse them!<br />I&rsquo;ve hanged some
dozens.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Worthy of yourself!<br />But yet the faith needs
here some mighty triumph&mdash;<br />Some bright example, whose resplendent
blaze<br />May tempt that fluttering tribe within the pale<br />Of Holy
Church again&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; To singe their wings?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll not come near enough.&nbsp; Again&mdash;there
are<br />Who dare arraign your prowess, and assert<br />A churchman&rsquo;s
energies were better spent<br />In pulpits than the tented field.&nbsp;
Now mark&mdash;<br />Mark, what a door is opened.&nbsp; Give but scope<br />To
this her huge capacity for sainthood&mdash;<br />Set her, a burning
and a shining light<br />To all your people&mdash;Such a sacrifice,<br />Such
loan to God of your own flesh and blood,<br />Will silence envious tongues,
and prove you wise<br />For the next world as for this; will clear your
name<br />From calumnies which argue worldliness;<br />Buy of itself
the joys of paradise;<br />And clench your lordship&rsquo;s interest
with the pontiff.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Well, well, we&rsquo;ll think on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Sir, I doubt you not.</p>
<p>[Re-enter Elizabeth.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Uncle, I am determined.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; So am I.<br />You shall to Marpurg with this
holy man.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah, there you speak again like my own uncle.<br />I&rsquo;ll
go&mdash;to rest [aside] and die.&nbsp; I only wait<br />To see the
bones of my beloved laid<br />In some fit resting-place.&nbsp; A messenger<br />Proclaims
them near.&nbsp; O God!</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go, my child,<br />And meeting them
with all due honour, show<br />In our own worship, honourable minds.</p>
<p>[Exit Elizabeth.]</p>
<p>A messenger!&nbsp; How far off are they, then?</p>
<p><i>Serv</i>.&nbsp; Some two days&rsquo; journey, sir.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Two days&rsquo; journey, and nought prepared?<br />Here,
chaplain&mdash;Brother Hippodamas!&nbsp; Chaplain, I say!&nbsp; [Hippodamas
enters.]&nbsp; Call the apparitor&mdash;ride off with him, right and
left&mdash;Don&rsquo;t wait even to take your hawk&mdash;Tell my knights
to be with me, with all their men-at-arms, at noon on the second day.&nbsp;
Let all be of the best, say&mdash;the brightest of arms and the newest
of garments.&nbsp; Mass! we must show our smartest before these crusaders&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
be full of new fashions, I warrant &rsquo;em&mdash;the monkeys that
have seen the world.&nbsp; And here, boy [to a page], set me a stoup
of wine in the oriel-room, and another for this good monk.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Pardon me, blessedness&mdash;but holy rule&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I forgot.&mdash;A pail of water and
a peck of beans for the holy man!&mdash;Order up my equerry, and bid
my armourer&mdash;vestryman, I mean&mdash;look out my newest robes.&mdash;Plague
on this gout.</p>
<p>[Exeunt, following the Bishop.]</p>

<h3>SCENE IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Nave of Bamberg Cathedral.&nbsp; A procession entering the West
Door, headed by Elizabeth and the Bishop, Nobles, etc.&nbsp; Religious
bearing the coffin which encloses Lewis&rsquo;s bones.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; See! the procession comes&mdash;the
mob streams in<br />At every door.&nbsp; Hark! how the steeples thunder<br />Their
solemn bass above the wailing choir.</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Lady</i>.&nbsp; They will stop at the screen.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; And there, as I hear, open the coffin.&nbsp;
Push forward, ladies, to that pillar: thence you will see all.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Oh dear! oh dear!&nbsp; If any man
had told me that I should ride forty miles on this errand, to see him
that went out flesh come home grass, like the flower of the field!</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; We have changed him, but not mended
him, say I, friend.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Never we.&nbsp; He knew where a yeoman&rsquo;s
heart lay!&nbsp; One that would clap a man on the back when his cow
died, and behave like a gentleman to him&mdash;that never met you after
a hailstorm without lightening himself of a few pocket-burners.</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Ay, that&rsquo;s your poor-man&rsquo;s
plaster: that&rsquo;s your right grease for this world&rsquo;s creaking
wheels.</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Nay, that&rsquo;s your rich man&rsquo;s
plaster too, and covers the multitude of sins.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your
big pike&rsquo;s swimming-bladder, that keeps him atop and feeding:
that&rsquo;s his calling and election, his oil of anointing, his <i>salvum
fac regem</i>, his yeoman of the wardrobe, who keeps the velvet-piled
side of this world uppermost, lest his delicate eyes should see the
warp that holds it.</p>
<p><i>2d</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s the warp, then?</p>
<p><i>1st</i> <i>Peas</i>.&nbsp; We, man, the friezes and fustians,
that rub on till we get frayed through with overwork, and then all&rsquo;s
abroad, and the nakedness of Babylon is discovered, and catch who catch
can.</p>
<p><i>Old Woman</i>.&nbsp; Pity they only brought his bones home!&nbsp;
He would have made a lovely corpse, surely.&nbsp; He was a proper man!</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; Oh the mincing step he had with him! and the
delicate hand on a horse, fingering the reins as St. Cicely does the
organ-keys!</p>
<p>2<i>d Lady</i>.&nbsp; And for hunting, another Siegfried.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; If he was Siegfried the gay, she was Chriemhild
the grim; and as likely to prove a firebrand as the girl in the ballad.</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; Gay, indeed!&nbsp; His smiles were like plumcake,
the sweeter the deeper iced.&nbsp; I never saw him speak civil word
to woman, but to her.</p>
<p><i>2d Lady</i>.&nbsp; O ye Saints!&nbsp; There was honey spilt on
the ground!&nbsp; If I had such a knight, I&rsquo;d never freeze alone
on the chamber-floor, like some that never knew when they were well
off.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never elbow him off to crusades with my pruderies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pluck your apples while they&rsquo;re ripe,<br />And pull
your flowers in May, O!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eh!&nbsp; Mother?</p>
<p><i>Old Woman</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Till when she grew wizened, and he
grew cold,<br />The balance lay even &rsquo;twixt young and old.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Monk</i>.&nbsp; Thus Satan bears witness perforce against the
vanities of Venus!&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s this babbling?&nbsp; Carolationes
in the holy place?&nbsp; Tace, vetula! taceas, taceto also, and that
forthwith.</p>
<p><i>Old Woman</i>.&nbsp; Tace in your teeth, and taceas also, begging-box!&nbsp;
Who put the halter round his waist to keep it off his neck,&mdash;who?&nbsp;
Get behind your screen, sirrah!&nbsp; Am I not a burgher&rsquo;s wife?&nbsp;
Am I not in the nave?&nbsp; Am I not on my own ground?&nbsp; Have I
brought up eleven children, without nurse wet or dry, to be taced nowadays
by friars in the nave?&nbsp; Help! good folks!&nbsp; Where be these
rooks a going?</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; The monk has vanished.</p>
<p><i>1st Peas</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ill letting out waters, he finds.&nbsp;
Who is that old gentleman, sir, holds the Princess so tight by the hand?</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Her uncle, knave, the Bishop.</p>
<p><i>1st Peas</i>.&nbsp; Very right, he: for she&rsquo;s almost a born
natural, poor soul.&nbsp; It was a temptation to deal with her.</p>
<p><i>2d Peas</i>.&nbsp; Thou didst cheat her shockingly, Frank, time
o&rsquo; the famine, on those nine sacks of maslin meal.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Go tell her of it, rascal, and she&rsquo;ll
thank you for it, and give you a shilling for helping her to a &lsquo;cross.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Old Woman</i>.&nbsp; Taceing free women in the nave!&nbsp; This
comes of your princesses, that turn the world upside down, and demean
themselves to hob and nob with these black baldicoots!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [in a low voice].&nbsp; I saw all Israel scattered on
the hills<br />As sheep that have no shepherd!&nbsp; O my people!<br />Who
crowd with greedy eyes round this my jewel,<br />Poor ivory, token of
his outward beauty&mdash;<br />Oh! had ye known his spirit!&mdash;Let
his wisdom<br />Inform your light hearts with that Saviour&rsquo;s likeness<br />For
whom he died!&nbsp; So had you kept him with you;<br />And from the
coming evils gentle Heaven<br />Had not withdrawn the righteous: &rsquo;tis
too late!</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; There, now, she smiles; do you think she ever
loved him?</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Never creature, but mealy-mouthed inquisitors,
and shaven singing birds.&nbsp; She looks now as glad to be rid of him
as any colt broke loose.</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; What will she do now, when this farce is over?</p>
<p><i>2d Lady</i>.&nbsp; Found an abbey, that&rsquo;s the fashion, and
elect herself abbess&mdash;tyrannise over hysterical girls, who are
forced to thank her for making them miserable, and so die a saint.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; Will you pray to her, my fair queen?</p>
<p><i>2d Lady</i>.&nbsp; Not I, sir; the old Saints send me lovers enough,
and to spare&mdash;yourself for one.</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; There is the giant-killer slain.&nbsp; But
see&mdash;they have stopped: who is that raising the coffin lid?</p>
<p><i>2d Lady</i>.&nbsp; Her familiar spirit, Conrad the heretic-catcher.</p>
<p><i>Knight</i>.&nbsp; I do defy him!&nbsp; Thou art my only goddess;<br />My
saint, my idol, my&mdash;ahem!</p>
<p><i>1st Lady</i>.&nbsp; That well&rsquo;s run dry.<br />Look, how
she trembles&mdash;Now she sinks, all shivering,<br />Upon the pavement&mdash;Why,
you&rsquo;ll see nought there<br />Flirting behind the pillar&mdash;Now
she rises&mdash;<br />And choking down that proud heart, turns to the
altar&mdash;<br />Her hand upon the coffin.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I thank thee, gracious Lord, who hast fulfilled<br />Thine
handmaid&rsquo;s mighty longings with the sight<br />Of my beloved&rsquo;s
bones, and dost vouchsafe<br />This consolation to the desolate.<br />I
grudge not, Lord, the victim which we gave Thee,<br />Both he and I,
of his most precious life,<br />To aid Thine holy city: though Thou
knowest<br />His sweetest presence was to this world&rsquo;s joy<br />As
sunlight to the taper&mdash;Oh! hadst Thou spared&mdash;<br />Had Thy
great mercy let us, hand in hand,<br />Have toiled through houseless
shame, on beggar&rsquo;s dole,<br />I had been blest: Thou hast him,
Lord, Thou hast him&mdash;<br />Do with us what Thou wilt!&nbsp; If
at the price<br />Of this one silly hair, in spite of Thee,<br />I could
reclothe these wan bones with his manhood,<br />And clasp to my shrunk
heart my hero&rsquo;s self&mdash;<br />I would not give it!<br />I will
weep no more&mdash;<br />Lead on, most holy; on the sepulchre<br />Which
stands beside the choir, lay down your burden.</p>
<p>[To the people.]</p>
<p>Now, gentle hosts, within the close hard by,<br />Will we our court,
as queen of sorrows, hold&mdash;<br />The green graves underneath us,
and above<br />The all-seeing vault, which is the eye of God,<br />Judge
of the widow and the fatherless.<br />There will I plead my children&rsquo;s
wrongs, and there,<br />If, as I think, there boil within your veins<br />The
deep sure currents of your race&rsquo;s manhood,<br />Ye&rsquo;ll nail
the orphans&rsquo; badge upon your shields,<br />And own their cause
for God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We name our champions&mdash;<br />Rudolf, the
Cupbearer, Leutolf of Erlstetten,<br />Hartwig of Erba, and our loved
Count Walter,<br />Our knights and vassals, sojourners among you.<br />Follow
us.</p>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE I</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Night.&nbsp; The church of a convent.&nbsp; Elizabeth, Conrad, Gerard,
Monks, an Abbess, Nuns, etc., in the distance.</p>
<p><i>Conrad</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this new weakness?&nbsp; At your
own request<br />We come to hear your self-imposed vows&mdash;<br />And
now you shrink: where are the high-flown fancies<br />Which but last
week, beside your husband&rsquo;s bier,<br />You vapoured forth?&nbsp;
Will you become a jest?<br />You might have counted this tower&rsquo;s
cost, before<br />You blazoned thus your plans abroad.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! spare me!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Spare?&nbsp; Spare yourself; and spare big easy
words,<br />Which prove your knowledge greater than your grace.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Is there no middle path?&nbsp; No way to keep<br />My
love for them, and God, at once unstained?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; If this were God&rsquo;s world, Madam, and not
the devil&rsquo;s,<br />It might be done.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s world, man!&nbsp; Why, God made it&mdash;<br />The
faith asserts it God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Potentially&mdash;<br />As every christened rogue&rsquo;s
a child of God,<br />Or those old hags, Christ&rsquo;s brides&mdash;Think
of your horn-book&mdash;<br />The world, the flesh, and the devil&mdash;a
goodly leash!<br />And yet God made all three.&nbsp; I know the fiend;<br />And
you should know the world: be sure, be sure.<br />The flesh is not a
stork among the cranes.<br />Our nature, even in Eden gross and vile,<br />And
by miraculous grace alone upheld,<br />Is now itself, and foul, and
damned, must die<br />Ere we can live; let halting worldlings, madam,<br />Maunder
against earth&rsquo;s ties, yet clutch them still.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; And yet God gave them to me&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; In the world;<br />Your babes are yours according
to the flesh;<br />How can you hate the flesh, and love its fruit?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; The Scripture bids me love them.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Truly so,<br />While you are forced to keep them;
when God&rsquo;s mercy<br />Doth from the flesh and world deliverance
offer,<br />Letting you bestow them elsewhere, then your love<br />May
cease with its own usefulness, and the spirit<br />Range in free battle
lists; I&rsquo;ll not waste reasons&mdash;<br />We&rsquo;ll leave you,
Madam, to the Spirit&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>[Conrad and Gerard withdraw.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [alone].&nbsp; Give up his children!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;d
not give up<br />A lock of hair, a glove his hand had hallowed:<br />And
they are his gift; his pledge; his flesh and blood<br />Tossed off for
my ambition!&nbsp; Ah! my husband!<br />His ghost&rsquo;s sad eyes upbraid
me!&nbsp; Spare me, spare me!<br />I&rsquo;d love thee still, if I dared;
but I fear God.<br />And shall I never more see loving eyes<br />Look
into mine, until my dying day?<br />That&rsquo;s this world&rsquo;s
bondage: Christ would have me free,<br />And &rsquo;twere a pious deed
to cut myself<br />The last, last strand, and fly: but whither? whither?<br />What
if I cast away the bird i&rsquo; the hand<br />And found none in the
bush?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis possible&mdash;<br />What right have I to arrogate
Christ&rsquo;s bride-bed?<br />Crushed, widowed, sold to traitors?&nbsp;
I, o&rsquo;er whom<br />His billows and His storms are sweeping?&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s not angry:<br />No, not so much as we with buzzing fly;<br />Or
in the moment of His wrath&rsquo;s awakening<br />We should be&mdash;nothing.&nbsp;
No&mdash;there&rsquo;s worse than that&mdash;<br />What if He but sat
still, and let be be?<br />And these deep sorrows, which my vain conceit<br />Calls
chastenings&mdash;meant for me&mdash;my ailments&rsquo; cure&mdash;<br />Were
lessons for some angels far away,<br />And I the corpus vile for the
experiment?<br />The grinding of the sharp and pitiless wheels<br />Of
some high Providence, which had its mainspring<br />Ages ago, and ages
hence its end?<br />That were too horrible!&mdash;<br />To have torn
up all the roses from my garden,<br />And planted thorns instead; to
have forged my griefs,<br />And hugged the griefs I dared not forge;
made earth<br />A hell, for hope of heaven; and after all,<br />These
homeless moors of life toiled through, to wake,<br />And find blank
nothing!&nbsp; Is that angel-world<br />A gaudy window, which we paint
ourselves<br />To hide the dead void night beyond?&nbsp; The present?<br />Why
here&rsquo;s the present&mdash;like this arched gloom,<br />It hems
our blind souls in, and roofs them over<br />With adamantine vault,
whose only voice<br />Is our own wild prayers&rsquo; echo: and our future?&mdash;<br />It
rambles out in endless aisles of mist,<br />The farther still the darker&mdash;O
my Saviour!<br />My God! where art Thou?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s but a tale
about Thee,<br />That crucifix above&mdash;it does but show Thee<br />As
Thou wast once, but not as Thou art now&mdash;<br />Thy grief, but not
Thy glory: where&rsquo;s that gone?<br />I see it not without me, and
within me<br />Hell reigns, not Thou!</p>
<p>[Dashes herself down on the altar steps.]</p>
<p>[Monks in the distance chanting.]</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kings&rsquo; daughters were among thine honourable women&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Kings&rsquo; daughters!&nbsp; I am one!</p>
<p><i>Monks</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline
thine ear:<br />Forget also thine own people, and thy father&rsquo;s
house,<br />So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty:<br />For
He is thy Lord God, and worship thou Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [springing up].&nbsp; I will forget them!<br />They
stand between my soul and its allegiance.<br />Thou art my God: what
matter if Thou love me?<br />I am Thy bond-slave, purchased with Thy
life-blood;<br />I will remember nothing, save that debt.<br />Do with
me what Thou wilt.&nbsp; Alas, my babies!<br />He loves them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
not need me.</p>
<p>[Conrad advancing.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; How now, Madam!<br />Have these your prayers unto
a nobler will<br />Won back that wandering heart?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s will is spoken!<br />The flesh is
weak; the spirit&rsquo;s fixed, and dares,&mdash;<br />Stay! confess,
sir,<br />Did not yourself set on your brothers here<br />To sing me
to your purpose?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; As I live<br />I meant it not; yet had I bribed
them to it,<br />Those words were no less God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I know it, I know it;<br />And I&rsquo;ll obey
them: come, the victim&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<p>[Lays her hand on the altar.&nbsp; Gerard, Abbess, and Monks descend
and advance.]</p>
<p>All worldly goods and wealth, which once I loved,<br />I do now count
but dross: and my beloved,<br />The children of my womb, I now regard<br />As
if they were another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; God is witness<br />My pride is
to despise myself; my joy<br />All insults, sneers, and slanders of
mankind;<br />No creature now I love, but God alone.<br />Oh, to be
clear, clear, clear, of all but Him!<br />Lo, here I strip me of all
earthly helps&mdash;</p>
<p>[Tearing off her clothes.]</p>
<p>Naked and barefoot through the world to follow<br />My naked Lord&mdash;And
for my filthy pelf&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Stop, Madam&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Why so, sir?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Upon thine oath!<br />Thy wealth is God&rsquo;s,
not thine&mdash;How darest renounce<br />The trust He lays on thee?&nbsp;
I do command thee,<br />Being, as Aaron, in God&rsquo;s stead, to keep
it<br />Inviolate, for the Church and thine own needs.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Be it so&mdash;I have no part nor lot in&rsquo;t&mdash;<br />There&mdash;I
have spoken.</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; O noble soul! which neither gold, nor love,<br />Nor
scorn can bend!</p>
<p><i>Gerard</i>.&nbsp; And think what pure devotions,<br />What holy
prayers must they have been, whose guerdon<br />Is such a flood of grace!</p>
<p><i>Nuns</i>.&nbsp; What love again!<br />What flame of charity, which
thus prevails<br />In virtue&rsquo;s guest!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Is self-contempt learnt thus?<br />I&rsquo;ll
home.</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; And yet how blest, in these cool shades<br />To
rest with us, as in a land-locked pool,<br />Touched last and lightest
by the ruffling breeze.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; No! no! no! no!&nbsp; I will not die in the dark:<br />I&rsquo;ll
breathe the free fresh air until the last,<br />Were it but a month&mdash;I
have such things to do&mdash;<br />Great schemes&mdash;brave schemes&mdash;and
such a little time!<br />Though now I am harnessed light as any foot-page.<br />Come,
come, my ladies.&nbsp; [Exeunt Elizabeth, etc.]</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Alas, poor lady!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Why alas, my son?<br />She longs to die a saint,
and here&rsquo;s the way to it.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Yet why so harsh? why with remorseless knife<br />Home
to the stem prune back each bough and bud?<br />I thought the task of
education was<br />To strengthen, not to crush; to train and feed<br />Each
subject toward fulfilment of its nature,<br />According to the mind
of God, revealed<br />In laws, congenital with every kind<br />And character
of man.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; A heathen dream!<br />Young souls but see the gay
and warm outside,<br />And work but in the shallow upper soil.<br />Mine
deeper, and the sour and barren rock<br />Will stop you soon enough.&nbsp;
Who trains God&rsquo;s Saints,<br />He must transform, not pet&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s
corrupt throughout&mdash;<br />A gaudy snake, which must be crushed,
not tamed,<br />A cage of unclean birds, deceitful ever;<br />Born in
the likeness of the fiend, which Adam<br />Did at the Fall, the Scripture
saith, put on.<br />Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook,<br />To
make him sport for thy maidens?&nbsp; Scripture saith<br />Who is the
prince of this world&mdash;so forget not.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Forgive, if my more weak and carnal judgment<br />Be
startled by your doctrines, and doubt trembling<br />The path whereon
you force yourself and her.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Startled?&nbsp; Belike&mdash;belike&mdash;let doctrines
be;<br />Thou shalt be judged by thy works; so see to them,<br />And
let divines split hairs: dare all thou canst;<br />Be all thou darest;&mdash;that
will keep thy brains full.<br />Have thy tools ready, God will find
thee work&mdash;<br />Then up, and play the man.&nbsp; Fix well thy
purpose&mdash;<br />Let one idea, like an orbed sun,<br />Rise radiant
in thine heaven; and then round it<br />All doctrines, forms, and disciplines
will range<br />As dim parhelia, or as needful clouds,<br />Needful,
but mist-begotten, to be dashed<br />Aside, when fresh shall serve thy
purpose better.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; How? dashed aside?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Yea, dashed aside&mdash;why not?<br />The truths,
my son, are safe in God&rsquo;s abysses&mdash;<br />While we patch up
the doctrines to look like them.<br />The best are tarnished mirrors&mdash;clumsy
bridges,<br />Whereon, as on firm soil, the mob may walk<br />Across
the gulf of doubt, and know no danger.<br />We, who see heaven, may
see the hell which girds it.<br />Blind trust for them.&nbsp; When I
came here from Rome,<br />Among the Alps, all through one frost-bound
dawn,<br />Waiting with sealed lips the noisy day,<br />I walked upon
a marble mead of snow&mdash;<br />An angel&rsquo;s spotless plume, laid
there for me:<br />Then from the hillside, in the melting noon,<br />Looked
down the gorge, and lo! no bridge, no snow&mdash;<br />But seas of writhing
glacier, gashed and scored<br />With splintered gulfs, and fathomless
crevasses,<br />Blue lips of hell, which sucked down roaring rivers<br />The
fiends who fled the sun.&nbsp; The path of Saints<br />Is such; so shall
she look from heaven, and see<br />The road which led her thither.&nbsp;
Now we&rsquo;ll go,<br />And find some lonely cottage for her lodging;<br />Her
shelter now is but a crumbling ruin<br />Roofed in with pine boughs&mdash;discipline
more healthy<br />For soul, than body: She&rsquo;s not ripe for death.</p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Open space in a suburb of Marpurg, near Elizabeth&rsquo;s Hut.&nbsp;
Count Walter and Count Pama of Hungary entering.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; I have prepared my nerves for a shock.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; You are wise, for the world&rsquo;s upside down
here.&nbsp; The last gateway brought us out of Christendom into the
New Jerusalem, the fifth Monarchy, where the Saints possess the earth.&nbsp;
Not a beggar here but has his pockets full of fair ladies&rsquo; tokens:
not a barefooted friar but rules a princess.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Creeping, I opine, into widows&rsquo; houses,
and for a pretence making long prayers.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t quote Scripture here, sir, especially
in that gross literal way!&nbsp; The new lights here have taught us
that Scripture&rsquo;s saying one thing, is a certain proof that it
means another.&nbsp; Except, by the bye, in one text.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask, and it shall be given you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; So we are to take nothing literally,
that they may take literally everything themselves?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Humph!&nbsp; As for your text, see if they do
not saddle it on us before the day is out, as glibly as ever you laid
it on them.&nbsp; Here comes the lady&rsquo;s tyrant, of whom I told
you.</p>
<p>[Conrad advances from the Hut.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; And what may Count Walter&rsquo;s valour want here?</p>
<p>[Count Walter turns his back.]</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; I come, Sir Priest, from Andreas, king renowned<br />Of
Hungary, ambassador unworthy<br />Unto the Landgravine, his saintly
daughter;<br />And fain would be directed to her presence.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; That is as I shall choose.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
not stop you.<br />I do not build with straw.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trust
my pupils<br />To worldlings&rsquo; honeyed tongues, who make long prayers,<br />And
enter widows&rsquo; houses for pretence.<br />There dwells the lady,
who has chosen too long<br />The better part, to have it taken from
her.<br />Besides that with strange dreams and revelations<br />She
has of late been edified.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Bah! but they will serve your turn&mdash;and
hers.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; When you have cut her off from child and friend,
and even Isentrudis and Guta, as I hear, are thrust out by you to starve,
and she sits there, shut up like a bear in a hole, to feed on her own
substance; if she has not some of these visions to look at, how is she,
or any other of your poor self-gorged prisoners, to help fancying herself
the only creature on earth?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; How now?&nbsp; Who more than she, in faith and
practice, a living member of the Communion of Saints?&nbsp; Did she
not lately publicly dispense in charity in a single day five hundred
marks and more?&nbsp; Is it not my continual labour to keep her from
utter penury through her extravagance in almsgiving?&nbsp; For whom
does she take thought but for the poor, on whom, day and night, she
spends her strength?&nbsp; Does she not tend them from the cradle, nurse
them, kiss their sores, feed them, bathe them, with her own hands, clothe
them, living and dead, with garments, the produce of her own labour?&nbsp;
Did she not of late take into her own house a paralytic boy, whose loathsomeness
had driven away every one else?&nbsp; And now that we have removed that
charge, has she not with her a leprous boy, to whose necessities she
ministers hourly, by day and night?&nbsp; What valley but blesses her
for some school, some chapel, some convent, built by her munificence?&nbsp;
Are not the hospices, which she has founded in divers towns, the wonder
of Germany?&mdash;wherein she daily feeds and houses a multitude of
the infirm poor of Christ?&nbsp; Is she not followed at every step by
the blessings of the poor?&nbsp; Are not her hourly intercessions for
the souls and bodies of all around incessant, world-famous, mighty to
save?&nbsp; While she lives only for the Church of Christ, will you
accuse her of selfish isolation?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; I tell you, monk, if she were not healthier
by God&rsquo;s making than ever she will be by yours, her charity would
be by this time double-distilled selfishness; the mouths she fed, cupboards
to store good works in; the backs she warmed, clothes-horses to hang
out her wares before God; her alms not given, but fairly paid, a halfpenny
for every halfpenny-worth of eternal life; earth her chess-board, and
the men and women on it merely pawns for her to play a winning game&mdash;puppets
and horn-books to teach her unit holiness&mdash;a private workshop in
which to work out her own salvation.&nbsp; Out upon such charity!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; God hath appointed that our virtuous deeds<br />Each
merit their rewards.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Go to&mdash;go to.&nbsp; I have watched you
and your crew, how you preach up selfish ambition for divine charity
and call prurient longings celestial love, while you blaspheme that
very marriage from whose mysteries you borrow all your cant.&nbsp; The
day will come when every husband and father will hunt you down like
vermin; and may I live to see it.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Out on thee, heretic!</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>. [drawing].&nbsp; Liar!&nbsp; At last?</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s name, sir, what if the Princess
find us?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ay&mdash;for her sake.&nbsp; But put that name
on me again, as you do on every good Catholic who will not be your slave
and puppet, and if thou goest home with ears and nose, there is no hot
blood in Germany.</p>
<p>[They move towards the cottage.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>. [alone].&nbsp; Were I as once I was, I could revenge:<br />But
now all private grudges wane like mist<br />In the keen sunlight of
my full intent;<br />And this man counts but for some sullen bull<br />Who
paws and mutters at unheeding pilgrims<br />His empty wrath: yet let
him bar my path,<br />Or stay me but one hour in my life-purpose,<br />And
I will fell him as a savage beast,<br />God&rsquo;s foe, not mine.&nbsp;
Beware thyself, Sir Count!</p>
<p>[Exit.&nbsp; The Counts return from the Cottage.]</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Shortly she will return; here to expect her<br />Is
duty both, and honour.&nbsp; Pardon me&mdash;<br />Her humours are well
known here?&nbsp; Passers by<br />Will guess who &rsquo;tis we visit?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Very likely.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Well, travellers see strange things&mdash;and
do them too.<br />Hem! this turf-smoke affects my breath: we might<br />Draw
back a space.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Certie, we were in luck,<br />Or both our noses
would have been snapped off<br />By those two she-dragons; how their
sainthoods squealed<br />To see a brace of beards peep in!&nbsp; Poor
child!<br />Two sweet companions for her loneliness!</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; But ah! what lodging!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis at that
my heart bleeds!<br />That hut, whose rough and smoke-embrowned spars<br />Dip
to the cold clay floor on either side!<br />Her seats bare deal!&mdash;her
only furniture<br />Some earthen crock or two!&nbsp; Why, sir, a dungeon<br />Were
scarce more frightful: such a choice must argue<br />Aberrant senses,
or degenerate blood!</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Were things foul?</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; I marked not, sir.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; I did.<br />You might have eat your dinner off
the floor.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Off any spot, sir, which a princess&rsquo;
foot<br />Had hallowed by its touch.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Most courtierly.<br />Keep, keep those sweet
saws for the lady&rsquo;s self.<br />[Aside]&nbsp; Unless that shock
of the nerves shall send them flying.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Yet whence this depth of poverty?&nbsp; I thought<br />You
and her champions had recovered for her<br />Her lands and titles.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ay; that coward Henry<br />Gave them all back
as lightly as he took them:<br />Certie, we were four gentle applicants&mdash;<br />And
Rudolph told him some unwelcome truths&mdash;<br />Would God that all
of us might hear our sins,<br />As Henry heard that day!</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Then she refused them?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;It ill befits,&rsquo; quoth she, &lsquo;my
royal blood,<br />To take extorted gifts; I tender back<br />By you
to him, for this his mortal life,<br />That which he thinks by treason
cheaply bought;<br />To which my son shall, in his father&rsquo;s right,<br />By
God&rsquo;s good will, succeed.&nbsp; For that dread height<br />May
Christ by many woes prepare his youth!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Humph!</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Why here&mdash;no, &rsquo;t cannot be&mdash;</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; What hither comes<br />Forth from the hospital,
where, as they told us,<br />The Princess labours in her holy duties?<br />A
parti-coloured ghost that stalks for penance?<br />Ah! a good head of
hair, if she had kept it<br />A thought less lank; a handsome face too,
trust me,<br />But worn to fiddle-strings; well, we&rsquo;ll be knightly&mdash;</p>
<p>[As Elizabeth meets him.]</p>
<p>Stop, my fair queen of rags and patches, turn<br />Those solemn eyes
a moment from your distaff,<br />And say, what tidings your magnificence<br />Can
bring us of the Princess?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I am she.</p>
<p>[Count Pama crosses himself and falls on his knees.]</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; O blessed saints and martyrs!&nbsp; Open, earth!<br />And
hide my recreant knighthood in thy gulf!<br />Yet, mercy, Madam! for
till this strange day<br />Who e&rsquo;er saw spinning wool, like village-maid,<br />A
royal scion?</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>. [kneeling].&nbsp; My beloved mistress!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Ah! faithful friend!&nbsp; Rise, gentles, rise,
for shame;<br />Nay, blush not, gallant sir.&nbsp; You have seen, ere
now,<br />Kings&rsquo; daughters do worse things than spinning wool,<br />Yet
never reddened.&nbsp; Speak your errand out.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; I from your father, Madam&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I divine;<br />And grieve that you so
far have journeyed, sir,<br />Upon a bootless quest.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; But hear me, Madam&mdash;<br />If you return
with me (o&rsquo;erwhelming honour!<br />For such mean bodyguard too
precious treasure)<br />Your father offers to you half his wealth;<br />And
countless hosts, whose swift and loyal blades<br />From traitorous grasp
shall vindicate your crown.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Wealth?&nbsp; I have proved it, and have tossed
it from me:<br />I will not stoop again to load with clay.<br />War?&nbsp;
I have proved that too: should I turn loose<br />On these poor sheep
the wolf whose fangs have gored me,<br />God&rsquo;s bolt would smite
me dead.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Madam, by his gray hairs he doth entreat you.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Alas! small comfort would they find in me!<br />I
am a stricken and most luckless deer,<br />Whose bleeding track but
draws the hounds of wrath<br />Where&rsquo;er I pause a moment.&nbsp;
He has children<br />Bred at his side, to nurse him in his age&mdash;<br />While
I am but an alien and a changeling,<br />Whom, ere my plastic sense
could impress take<br />Either of his feature or his voice, he lost.</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; Then pardon, Madam, but your
father<br />Must by a father&rsquo;s right command&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Command!&nbsp; Ay, that&rsquo;s the phrase of
the world: well&mdash;tell him,<br />But tell him gently too&mdash;that
child and father<br />Are names, whose earthly sense I have forsworn,<br />And
know no more: I have a heavenly spouse,<br />Whose service doth all
other claims annul.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; Ah, lady, dearest lady, be but ruled!<br />Your
Saviour will be there as near as here.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Thou too, friend?&nbsp; Dost thou
not know me better?<br />Wouldst have me leave undone what I begin?<br />[To
Count Pama]&nbsp; My father took the cross, sir: so did I:<br />As he
would die at his post, so will I die:<br />He is a warrior: ask him,
should I leave<br />This my safe fort, and well-proved vantage-ground,<br />To
roam on this world&rsquo;s flat and fenceless steppes?</p>
<p><i>C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Pardon me, Madam, if my grosser wit<br />Fail
to conceive your sense.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; It is not needed.<br />Be but the mouthpiece to
my father, sir;<br />And tell him&mdash;for I would not anger him&mdash;<br />Tell
him, I am content&mdash;say, happy&mdash;tell him<br />I prove my kin
by prayers for him, and masses<br />For her who bore me.&nbsp; We shall
meet on high.<br />And say, his daughter is a mighty tree,<br />From
whose wide roots a thousand sapling suckers,<br />Drink half their life;
she dare not snap the threads,<br />And let her offshoots wither.&nbsp;
So farewell.<br />Within the convent there, as mine own guests,<br />You
shall be fitly lodged.&nbsp; Come here no more.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal.&nbsp; C. Pama</i>.&nbsp; Farewell, sweet Saint!&nbsp;
[Exeunt.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; May God go with you both.<br />No!&nbsp; I will
win for him a nobler name,<br />Than captive crescents, piles of turbaned
heads,<br />Or towns retaken from the Tartar, give.<br />In me he shall
be greatest; my report<br />Shall through the ages win the quires of
heaven<br />To love and honour him; and hinds, who bless<br />The poor
man&rsquo;s patron saint, shall not forget<br />How she was fathered
with a worthy sire.&nbsp; [Exit.]</p>

<h3>SCENE III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Night.&nbsp; Interior of Elizabeth&rsquo;s hut.&nbsp; A leprous boy
sleeping on a Mattress.&nbsp; Elizabeth watching by him.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; My shrunk limbs, stiff from many a blow,<br />Are
crazed with pain.<br />A long dim formless fog-bank, creeping low,<br />Dulls
all my brain.</p>
<p>I remember two young lovers,<br />In a golden gleam.<br />Across
the brooding darkness shrieking hovers<br />That fair, foul dream.</p>
<p>My little children call to me,<br />&lsquo;Mother! so soon forgot?&rsquo;<br />From
out dark nooks their yearning faces startle me,<br />Go, babes!&nbsp;
I know you not!</p>
<p>Pray! pray! or thou&rsquo;lt go mad.<br />. . . . .<br />The past&rsquo;s
our own:<br />No fiend can take that from us!&nbsp; Ah, poor boy!<br />Had
I, like thee, been bred from my black birth-hour<br />In filth and shame,
counting the soulless months<br />Only by some fresh ulcer!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
be patient&mdash;<br />Here&rsquo;s something yet more wretched than
myself.<br />Sleep thou on still, poor charge&mdash;though I&rsquo;ll
not grudge<br />One moment of my sickening toil about thee,<br />Best
counsellor&mdash;dumb preacher, who dost warn me<br />How much I have
enjoyed, how much have left,<br />Which thou hast never known.&nbsp;
How am I wretched?<br />The happiness thou hast from me, is mine,<br />And
makes me happy.&nbsp; Ay, there lies the secret&mdash;<br />Could we
but crush that ever-craving lust<br />For bliss, which kills all bliss,
and lose our life,<br />Our barren unit life, to find again<br />A thousand
lives in those for whom we die.<br />So were we men and women, and should
hold<br />Our rightful rank in God&rsquo;s great universe,<br />Wherein,
in heaven and earth, by will or nature,<br />Nought lives for self&mdash;All,
all&mdash;from crown to footstool&mdash;<br />The Lamb, before the world&rsquo;s
foundations slain&mdash;<br />The angels, ministers to God&rsquo;s elect&mdash;<br />The
sun, who only shines to light a world&mdash;<br />The clouds, whose
glory is to die in showers&mdash;<br />The fleeting streams, who in
their ocean-graves<br />Flee the decay of stagnant self-content&mdash;<br />The
oak, ennobled by the shipwright&rsquo;s axe&mdash;<br />The soil, which
yields its marrow to the flower&mdash;<br />The flower, which feeds
a thousand velvet worms,<br />Born only to be prey for every bird&mdash;<br />All
spend themselves for others: and shall man,<br />Earth&rsquo;s rosy
blossom&mdash;image of his God&mdash;<br />Whose twofold being is the
mystic knot<br />Which couples earth and heaven&mdash;doubly bound<br />As
being both worm and angel, to that service<br />By which both worms
and angels hold their life&mdash;<br />Shall he, whose every breath
is debt on debt,<br />Refuse, without some hope of further wage<br />Which
he calls Heaven, to be what God has made him?<br />No! let him show
himself the creature&rsquo;s lord<br />By freewill gift of that self-sacrifice<br />Which
they perforce by nature&rsquo;s law must suffer.<br />This too I had
to learn (I thank thee, Lord!),<br />To lie crushed down in darkness
and the pit&mdash;<br />To lose all heart and hope&mdash;and yet to
work.<br />What lesson could I draw from all my own woes&mdash;<br />Ingratitude,
oppression, widowhood&mdash;<br />While I could hug myself in vain conceits<br />Of
self-contented sainthood&mdash;inward raptures&mdash;<br />Celestial
palms&mdash;and let ambition&rsquo;s gorge<br />Taint heaven, as well
as earth?&nbsp; Is selfishness<br />For time, a sin&mdash;spun out to
eternity<br />Celestial prudence?&nbsp; Shame!&nbsp; Oh, thrust me forth,<br />Forth,
Lord, from self, until I toil and die<br />No more for Heaven and bliss,
but duty, Lord,<br />Duty to Thee, although my meed should be<br />The
hell which I deserve!</p>
<p>[Sleeps.]</p>
<p>[Two women enter.]</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; What! snoring still?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nearly
time to wake her<br />To do her penance.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; Wait a while, for love:<br />Indeed, I am
almost ashamed to punish<br />A bag of skin and bones.</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for her good:<br />She has had
her share of pleasure in this life<br />With her gay husband; she must
have her pain.<br />We bear it as a thing of course; we know<br />What
mortifications are, although I say it<br />That should not.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; Why, since my old tyrant died,<br />Fasting
I&rsquo;ve sought the Lord, like any Anna,<br />And never tasted fish,
nor flesh, nor fowl,<br />And little stronger than water.</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; Plague on this watching!<br />What work,
to make a saint of a fine lady!<br />See now, if she had been some labourer&rsquo;s
daughter,<br />She might have saved herself, for aught he cared;<br />But
now&mdash;</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; Hush! here the master comes:<br />I hear him.&mdash;</p>
<p>[Conrad enters.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; My peace, most holy, wise, and watchful wardens!<br />She
sleeps?&nbsp; Well, what complaints have you to bring<br />Since last
we met?&nbsp; How? blowing up the fire?<br />Cold is the true saint&rsquo;s
element&mdash;he thrives<br />Like Alpine gentians, where the frost
is keenest&mdash;<br />For there Heaven&rsquo;s nearest&mdash;and the
ether purest&mdash;<br />[Aside]&nbsp; And he most bitter.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; Ah! sweet master,<br />We are not yet as perfect
as yourself.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; But how has she behaved?</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; Just like herself&mdash;<br />Now ruffling
up like any tourney queen;<br />Now weeping in dark corners; then next
minute<br />Begging for penance on her knees.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; One trick&rsquo;s cured;<br />That lust of
giving; Isentrude and Guta,<br />The hussies, came here begging but
yestreen,<br />Vowed they were starving.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Did she give to them?</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; She told them that she dared not.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; For them,<br />I will take measures
that they shall not want:<br />But see you tell her not: she must be
perfect.</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, there&rsquo;s not much chance of
that a while.<br />There&rsquo;s others, might be saints, if they were
young,<br />And handsome, and had titles to their names,<br />If they
were helped toward heaven, now&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Silence, horse-skull!<br />Thank God, that you
are allowed to use a finger<br />Towards building up His chosen tabernacle.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; I consider that she blasphemes the means of
grace.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Eh? that&rsquo;s a point, indeed.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; Why, yesterday,<br />Within the church, before
a mighty crowd,<br />She mocked at all the lovely images,<br />And said
&lsquo;the money had been better spent<br />On food and clothes, instead
of paint and gilding:<br />They were but pictures, whose reality<br />We
ought to bear within us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Awful doctrine!</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; Look at her carelessness, again&mdash;the
distaff<br />Or woolcomb in her hands, even on her bed.<br />Then, when
the work is done, she lets those nuns<br />Cheat her of half the price.</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; The Aldenburgers.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Well, well, what more misdoings?<br />[aside]&nbsp;
Pah!&nbsp; I am sick on&rsquo;t.<br />[Aloud]&nbsp; Go sit, and pray
by her until she wakes.</p>
<p>]The women retire.&nbsp; Conrad sits down by the fire.]</p>
<p>I am dwindling to a peddling chamber-chaplain,<br />Who hunts for
crabs and ballads in maids&rsquo; sleeves,<br />I, who have shuffled
kingdoms.&nbsp; Oh! &rsquo;tis easy<br />To beget great deeds; but in
the rearing of them&mdash;<br />The threading in cold blood each mean
detail,<br />And furzebrake of half-pertinent circumstance&mdash;<br />There
lies the self-denial.</p>
<p><i>Women</i> [in a low voice].&nbsp; Master! sir! look here!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [rising].&nbsp; Have mercy, mercy, Lord!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; What is it, my daughter?&nbsp; No&mdash;she answers
not&mdash;<br />Her eyeballs through their sealed lids are bursting,<br />And
yet she sleeps: her body does but mimic<br />The absent soul&rsquo;s
enfranchised wanderings<br />In the spirit-world.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! she was but a worldling!<br />And think, good
Lord, if that this world is hell,<br />What wonder if poor souls whose
lot is fixed here,<br />Meshed down by custom, wealth, rank, pleasure,
ignorance,<br />Do hellish things in it?&nbsp; Have mercy, Lord;<br />Even
for my sake, and all my woes, have mercy!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; There! she is laid again&mdash;Some bedlam dream.<br />So&mdash;here
I sit; am I a guardian angel<br />Watching by God&rsquo;s elect? or
nightly tiger,<br />Who waits upon a dainty point of honour<br />To
clutch his prey, till it shall wake and move?<br />We&rsquo;ll waive
that question: there&rsquo;s eternity<br />To answer that in.<br />How
like a marble-carven nun she lies<br />Who prays with folded palms upon
her tomb,<br />Until the resurrection!&nbsp; Fair and holy!<br />O happy
Lewis!&nbsp; Had I been a knight&mdash;<br />A man at all&mdash;What&rsquo;s
this?&nbsp; I must be brutal,<br />Or I shall love her: and yet that&rsquo;s
no safeguard;<br />I have marked it oft: ay&mdash;with that devilish
triumph<br />Which eyes its victim&rsquo;s writhings, still will mingle<br />A
sympathetic thrill of lust&mdash;say, pity.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [awaking].&nbsp; I am heard!&nbsp; She is saved!<br />Where
am I?&nbsp; What! have I overslept myself?<br />Oh, do not beat me!&nbsp;
I will tell you all&mdash;<br />I have had awful dreams of the other
world.</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; Ay! ay! a fine excuse for lazy women,<br />Who
cry nightmare with lying on their backs.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I will be heard!&nbsp; I am a prophetess!<br />God
hears me, why not ye?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Quench not the Spirit:<br />If He have spoken,
daughter, we must listen.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Methought from out the red and heaving earth<br />My
mother rose, whose broad and queenly limbs<br />A fiery arrow did impale,
and round<br />Pursuing tongues oozed up of nether fire,<br />And fastened
on her: like a winter-blast<br />Among the steeples, then she shrieked
aloud,<br />&lsquo;Pray for me, daughter; save me from this torment,<br />For
thou canst save!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then she told a tale;<br />It was
not true&mdash;my mother was not such&mdash;<br />O God!&nbsp; The pander
to a brother&rsquo;s sin!</p>
<p><i>1st Woman</i>.&nbsp; There now?&nbsp; The truth is out!&nbsp;
I told you, sister,<br />About that mother&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Silence, hags! what then?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; She stretched her arms, and sank.&nbsp; Was it
a sin<br />To love that sinful mother?&nbsp; There I lay&mdash;<br />And
in the spirit far away I prayed;<br />What words I spoke, I know not,
nor how long;<br />Until a small still voice sighed, &lsquo;Child, thou
art heard:&rsquo;<br />Then on the pitchy dark a small bright cloud<br />Shone
out, and swelled, and neared, and grew to form,<br />Till from it blazed
my pardoned mother&rsquo;s face<br />With nameless glory!&nbsp; Nearer
still she pressed,<br />And bent her lips to mine&mdash;a mighty spasm<br />Ran
crackling through my limbs, and thousand bells<br />Rang in my dizzy
ears&mdash;And so I woke.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but a dream.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas more! &rsquo;twas more!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
tests:<br />From youth I have lived in two alternate worlds,<br />And
night is live like day.&nbsp; This was no goblin!<br />&rsquo;Twas a
true vision, and my mother&rsquo;s soul<br />Is freed by my poor prayers
from penal files,<br />And waits for me in bliss.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;be it so then.<br />Thou seest herein
what prize obedience merits.<br />Now to press forwards: I require your
presence<br />Within the square, at noon, to witness there<br />The
fiery doom&mdash;most just and righteous doom&mdash;<br />Of two convicted
and malignant heretics,<br />Who at the stake shall expiate their crime,<br />And
pacify God&rsquo;s wrath against this land.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; No! no!&nbsp; I will not go!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; Thou wilt not?<br />I&rsquo;ll
drive thee there with blows.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Then I will bear them,<br />Even as I bore the
last, with thankful thoughts<br />Upon those stripes my Lord endured
for me.<br />Oh, spare them, sir! poor blindfold sons of men!<br />No
saint but daily errs,&mdash;and must they burn,<br />Ah, God! for an
opinion?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Fool! opinions?<br />Who cares for their opinions?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis rebellion<br />Against the system which upholds the world<br />For
which they die: so, lest the infection spread,<br />We must cut off
the members, whose disease<br />We&rsquo;d pardon, could they keep it
to themselves.</p>
<p>[Elizabeth weeps.]</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll not urge it,&mdash;Thou hast other work&mdash;<br />But
for thy petulant words do thou this penance:<br />I do forbid thee here,
to give henceforth<br />Food, coin, or clothes, to any living soul.<br />Thy
thriftless waste doth scandalise the elect,<br />And maim thine usefulness:
thou dost elude<br />My wise restrictions still: &rsquo;Tis great, to
live<br />Poor, among riches; when thy wealth is spent,<br />Want is
not merit, but necessity.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh, let me give!<br />That only pleasure have
I left on earth!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; And for that very cause thou must forego it,<br />And
so be perfect.&nbsp; She who lives in pleasure<br />Is dead, while yet
she lives; grace brings no merit<br />When &rsquo;tis the express of
our own self-will.<br />To shrink from what we practise; do God&rsquo;s
work<br />In spite of loathings; that&rsquo;s the path of saints.<br />I
have said.&nbsp; [Exit with the women.]</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I am freezing fast&mdash;I have grown
of late<br />Too weak to nurse my sick; and now this outlet,<br />This
one last thawing spring of fellow-feeling,<br />Is choked with ice&mdash;Come,
Lord, and set me free.<br />Think me not hasty! measure not mine age,<br />O
Lord, by these my four-and-twenty winters.<br />I have lived three lives&mdash;three
lives.<br />For fourteen years I was an idiot girl:<br />Then I was
born again; and for five years,<br />I lived!&nbsp; I lived! and then
I died once more;&mdash;<br />One day when many knights came marching
by,<br />And stole away&mdash;we&rsquo;ll talk no more of that.<br />And
so these four years since, I have been dead,<br />And all my life is
hid with Christ in God.<br />Nunc igitur dimittas, Domine, servam tuam.</p>

<h3>SCENE IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The same.&nbsp; Elizabeth lying on straw in a corner.&nbsp; A crowd
of women round her.&nbsp; Conrad entering.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; As I expected&mdash;<br />A sermon-mongering herd
about her death-bed,<br />Stifling her with fusty sighs, as flocks of
rooks<br />Despatch, with pious pecks, a wounded brother.<br />Cant,
howl, and whimper!&nbsp; Not an old fool in the town<br />Who thinks
herself religious, but must see<br />The last of the show and mob the
deer to death.<br />[Advancing]&nbsp; Hail! holy ones!&nbsp; How fares
your charge to-day?</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; After the blessed sacrament received,<br />As
surfeited with those celestial viands,<br />And with the blood of life
intoxicate,<br />She lay entranced: and only stirred at times<br />To
eructate sweet edifying doctrine<br />Culled from your darling sermons.</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Heavenly grace<br />Imbues her so throughout,
that even when pricked<br />She feels no pain.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; A miracle, no doubt.<br />Heaven&rsquo;s work is
ripe, and like some more I know,<br />Having begun in the spirit, in
the flesh<br />She&rsquo;s now made perfect: she hath had warnings,
too,<br />Of her decease; and prophesied to me,<br />Three weeks ago,
when I lay like to die,<br />That I should see her in her coffin yet.</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis said, she heard in dreams her Saviour
call her<br />To mansions built for her from everlasting.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Ay, so she said.</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; But tell me, in her confession<br />Was there
no holy shame&mdash;no self-abhorrence<br />For the vile pleasures of
her carnal wedlock?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; She said no word thereon: as for her shrift,<br />No
Chrisom child could show a chart of thoughts<br />More spotless than
were hers.</p>
<p><i>Nun</i>.&nbsp; Strange, she said nought;<br />I had hoped she
had grown more pure.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; When, next, I asked her,<br />How she would be
interred; &lsquo;In the vilest weeds,&rsquo;<br />Quoth she, &lsquo;my
poor hut holds; I will not pamper<br />When dead, that flesh, which
living I despised.<br />And for my wealth, see it to the last doit<br />Bestowed
upon the poor of Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>2d Woman</i>.&nbsp; O grace!</p>
<p><i>3d Woman</i>.&nbsp; O soul to this world poor, but rich toward
God!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [awaking].&nbsp; Hark! how they cry for bread!<br />Poor
souls! be patient!<br />I have spent all&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll sell
myself for a slave&mdash;feed them with the price.<br />Come, Guta!&nbsp;
Nurse!&nbsp; We must be up and doing!<br />Alas! they are gone, and
begging!<br />Go! go!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll beat me, if I give you aught:<br />I&rsquo;ll
pray for you, and so you&rsquo;ll go to Heaven.<br />I am a saint&mdash;God
grants me all I ask.<br />But I must love no creature.&nbsp; Why, Christ
loved&mdash;<br />Mary he loved, and Martha, and their brother&mdash;<br />Three
friends! and I have none!<br />When Lazarus lay dead, He groaned in
spirit,<br />And wept&mdash;like any widow&mdash;Jesus wept!<br />I&rsquo;ll
weep, weep, weep! pray for that &lsquo;gift of tears.&rsquo;<br />They
took my friends away, but not my eyes,<br />Oh, husband, babes, friends,
nurse!&nbsp; To die alone!<br />Crack, frozen brain!&nbsp; Melt, icicle
within!</p>
<p><i>Women</i>.&nbsp; Alas! sweet saint!&nbsp; By bitter pangs she
wins<br />Her crown of endless glory!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; But she wins it!<br />Stop that vile sobbing! she&rsquo;s
unmanned enough<br />Without your maudlin sympathy.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; What? weeping?<br />Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
not for me&mdash;<br />Weep for yourselves.</p>
<p><i>Women</i>.&nbsp; We do, alas! we do!<br />What are we without
you?&nbsp; [A pause.]</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Oh, listen, listen!<br />What sweet sounds from
her fast-closed lips are welling,<br />As from the caverned shaft, deep
miners&rsquo; songs?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>. [in a low voice].&nbsp; Through the stifling room<br />Floats
strange perfume;<br />Through the crumbling thatch<br />The angels watch,<br />Over
the rotting roof-tree.<br />They warble, and flutter, and hover, and
glide,<br />Wafting old sounds to my dreary bedside,<br />Snatches of
songs which I used to know<br />When I slept by my nurse, and the swallows<br />Called
me at day-dawn from under the eaves.<br />Hark to them!&nbsp; Hark to
them now&mdash;<br />Fluting like woodlarks, tender and low&mdash;<br />Cool
rustling leaves&mdash;tinkling waters&mdash;<br />Sheepbells over the
lea&mdash;<br />In their silver plumes Eden-gales whisper&mdash;<br />In
their hands Eden-lilies&mdash;not for me&mdash;not for me&mdash;<br />No
crown for the poor fond bride!<br />The song told me so,<br />Long,
long ago,<br />How the maid chose the white lily;<br />But the bride
she chose<br />The red red rose,<br />And by its thorn died she.<br />Well&mdash;in
my Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions&mdash;<br />I have trodden
the waste howling ocean-foam,<br />Till I stand upon Canaan&rsquo;s
shore,<br />Where Crusaders from Zion&rsquo;s towers call me home,<br />To
the saints who are gone before.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Still on Crusaders?&nbsp; [Aside.]</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; What was that sweet song, which just now, my
Princess,<br />You murmured to yourself?</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Did you not hear<br />A little bird between me
and the wall,<br />That sang and sang?</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; We heard him not, fair Saint.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I heard him, and his merry carol revelled<br />Through
all my brain, and woke my parched throat<br />To join his song: then
angel melodies<br />Burst through the dull dark, and the mad air quivered<br />Unutterable
music.&nbsp; Nay, you heard him.</p>
<p><i>Abbess</i>.&nbsp; Nought save yourself.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Slow hours!&nbsp; Was that the cock-crow?</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; St. Peter&rsquo;s bird did call.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Then I must up&mdash;<br />To matins, and to work&mdash;No,
my work&rsquo;s over.<br />And what is it, what?<br />One drop of oil
on the salt seething ocean!<br />Thank God, that one was born at this
same hour,<br />Who did our work for us: we&rsquo;ll talk of Him:<br />We
shall go mad with thinking of ourselves&mdash;<br />We&rsquo;ll talk
of Him, and of that new-made star,<br />Which, as he stooped into the
Virgin&rsquo;s side,<br />From off His finger, like a signet-gem,<br />He
dropped in the empyrean for a sign.<br />But the first tear He shed
at this His birth-hour,<br />When He crept weeping forth to see our
woe,<br />Fled up to Heaven in mist, and hid for ever<br />Our sins,
our works, and that same new-made star.</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Poor soul! she wanders!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Wanders, fool? her madness<br />Is worth a million
of your paters, mumbled<br />At every station between&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; Oh! thank God<br />Our eyes are dim!&nbsp; What
should we do, if he,<br />The sneering fiend, who laughs at all our
toil,<br />Should meet us face to face?</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d call him fool.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Fly, Satan, fly!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis gone!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The victory&rsquo;s gained at last!<br />The fiend
is baffled, and her saintship sure!<br />O people blest of Heaven!</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O master, master,<br />You will not let the mob,
when I lie dead,<br />Make me a show&mdash;paw over all my limbs&mdash;<br />Pull
out my hair&mdash;pluck off my finger-nails&mdash;<br />Wear scraps
of me for charms and amulets,<br />As if I were a mummy, or a drug?<br />As
they have done to others&mdash;I have seen it&mdash;<br />Nor set me
up in ugly naked pictures<br />In every church, that cold world-hardened
wits<br />May gossip o&rsquo;er my secret tortures?&nbsp; Promise&mdash;<br />Swear
to me!&nbsp; I demand it!</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; No man lights<br />A candle, to be hid beneath
a bushel:<br />Thy virtues are the Church&rsquo;s dower: endure<br />All
which the edification of the faithful<br />Makes needful to be published.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; O my God!<br />I had stripped myself of all, but
modesty!<br />Dost Thou claim yet that victim?&nbsp; Be it so.<br />Now
take me home!&nbsp; I have no more to give Thee!<br />So weak&mdash;and
yet no pain&mdash;why, now naught ails me!<br />How dim the lights burn!&nbsp;
Here&mdash;<br />Where are you, children?<br />Alas!&nbsp; I had forgotten.<br />Now
I must sleep&mdash;for ere the sun shall rise,<br />I must begone upon
a long, long journey<br />To him I love.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; She means her heavenly Bridegroom&mdash;<br />The
Spouse of souls.</p>
<p><i>Eliz</i>.&nbsp; I said, to him I love.<br />Let me sleep, sleep.<br />You
will not need to wake me&mdash;so&mdash;good-night.</p>
<p>[Folds herself into an attitude of repose.&nbsp; The scene closes.]</p>

<h2>ACT V</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SCENE I.&nbsp; A.D. 1235.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Convent at Marpurg.&nbsp; Cloisters of the infirmary.&nbsp; Two
aged monks sitting.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; So they will publish to-day the Landgravine&rsquo;s
canonisation, and translate her to the new church prepared for her.&nbsp;
Alack, now, that all the world should be out sight-seeing and saint-making,
and we laid up here, like two lame jackdaws in a belfry!</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Let be, man&mdash;let be.&nbsp; We have seen
sights and saints in our time.&nbsp; And, truly, this insolatio suits
my old bones better than processioning.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pleasant enough in the sun, were
it not for the flies.&nbsp; Look&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lizard.&nbsp;
Come you here, little run-about; here&rsquo;s game for you.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; A tame fool, and a gay one&mdash;Munditi&aelig;
mundanis.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Catch him a fat fly&mdash;my hand shaketh.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; If one of your new-lights were here, now, he&rsquo;d
pluck him for a fiend, as Dominic did the live sparrow in chapel.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; There will be precious offerings made to-day,
of which our house will get its share.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Not we; she always favoured the Franciscans
most.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but fair&mdash;they were her kith
and kin.<br />She lately put on the habit of their third minors.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; So have half the fine gentlemen and ladies
in Europe.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one of your new inventions, now, for
letting grand folks serve God and mammon at once, and emptying honest
monasteries, where men give up all for the Gospel&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
And now these Pharisees of Franciscans will go off with full pockets&mdash;</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; While we poor publicans&mdash;</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Shall not come home all of us justified, I
think.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Is there scandal among us?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Ask not&mdash;ask not.&nbsp; Even a fool, when
he holds his peace, is counted wise.&nbsp; Of all sins, avoid that same
gossiping.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Nay, tell me now.&nbsp; Are we not like David
and Jonathan?&nbsp; Have we not worked together, prayed together, journeyed
together, and been soundly flogged together, more by token, any time
this forty years?&nbsp; And now is news so plenty, that thou darest
to defraud me of a morsel?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell thee&mdash;but be secret.&nbsp;
I knew a man hard by the convent [names are dangerous, and a bird of
the air shall carry the matter], one that hath a mighty eye for a heretic,
if thou knowest him.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Who carries his poll screwed on over-tight,
and sits with his eyes shut in chapel?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; The same.&nbsp; Such a one to be in evil savour&mdash;to
have the splendour of the pontifical countenance turned from him, as
though he had taken Christians for Amalekites, and slain the people
of the Lord.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; I only speak as I hear: for my sister&rsquo;s
son is chaplain, for the time being, to a certain Archisacerdos, a foreigner,
now lodging where thou knowest.&nbsp; The young mail being hid, after
some knavery, behind the arras, in come our quidam and that prelate.&nbsp;
The quidam, surly and Saxon&mdash;the guest, smooth and Italian; his
words softer than butter, yet very swords: that this quidam had &lsquo;exceeded
the bounds of his commission&mdash;launched out into wanton and lawless
cruelty&mdash;burnt noble ladies unheard, of whose innocence the Holy
See had proof&mdash;defiled the Catholic faith in the eyes of the weaker
sort&mdash;and alienated the minds of many nobles and gentlemen&rsquo;&mdash;and
finally, that he who thinketh he standeth, were wise to take heed lest
he fall.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; And what said Conrad?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Out upon a man that cannot keep his lips!&nbsp;
Who spake of Conrad?&nbsp; That quidam, however, answered nought, but&mdash;how
&lsquo;to his own master he stood or fell&rsquo;&mdash;how &lsquo;he
laboured not for the Pope but for the Papacy&rsquo;; and so forth.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Here is awful doctrine!&nbsp; Behold the fruit
of your reformers!&nbsp; This comes of their realised ideas, and centralisations,
and organisations, till a monk cannot wink in chapel without being blinded
with the lantern, or fall sick on Fridays, for fear of the rod.&nbsp;
Have I not testified?&nbsp; Have I not foretold?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Thou hast indeed.&nbsp; Thou knowest that the
old paths are best, and livest in most pious abhorrence of all amendment.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Do you hear that shout?&nbsp; There is the
procession returning from the tomb.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Hark to the tramp of the horse-hoofs!&nbsp;
A gallant show, I&rsquo;ll warrant!</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Time was, now, when we were young bloods together
in the world, such a roll as that would have set our hearts beating
against their cages!</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Ay, ay.&nbsp; We have seen sport in our day;
we have paraded and curvetted, eh? and heard scabbards jingle?&nbsp;
We know the sly touch of the heel, that set him on his hind legs before
the right window.&nbsp; Vanitas vanitatum&mdash;omnia vanitas!&nbsp;
Here comes Gerard, Conrad&rsquo;s chaplain, with our dinner.</p>
<p>[Gerard enters across the court.]</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; A kindly youth and a godly, but&mdash;reformation-bitten,
like the rest.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Never care.&nbsp; Boys must take the reigning
madness in religion, as they do the measles&mdash;once for all.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Once too often for him.&nbsp; His face is
too, too like Abel&rsquo;s in the chapel-window.&nbsp; Ut sis vitalis
metuo, puer!</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Hail, fathers.&nbsp; I have asked permission of
the prior to minister your refection, and bring you thereby the first
news of the pageant.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Blessings on thee for a good boy.&nbsp; Give
us the trenchers, and open thy mouth while we open ours.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Most splendid all, no doubt?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; A garden, sir,<br />Wherein all rainbowed flowers
were heaped together;<br />A sea of silk and gold, of blazoned banners,<br />And
chargers housed; such glorious press, be sure,<br />Thuringen-land ne&rsquo;er
saw.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Just hear the boy!<br />Who rode beside the
bier?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Frederic the Kaiser,<br />Henry the Landgrave,
brother of her husband;<br />The Princesses, too, Agnes, and her mother;<br />And
every noble name, sir, at whose war-cry<br />The Saxon heart leaps up;
with them the prelates<br />Of Treves, of C&ouml;ln, and Maintz&mdash;why
name them all?<br />When all were there, whom this our fatherland<br />Counts
worthy of its love.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but her right.<br />Who spoke
the oration?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Who but Conrad?</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;<br />That&rsquo;s honour to our
house.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Come, tell us all.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; In order, boy: thou hast a ready tongue.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; He raised from off her face the pall, and &lsquo;Lo!&rsquo;<br />He
cried, &lsquo;that saintly flesh which ye of late<br />With sacrilegious
hands, ere yet entombed,<br />Had in your superstitious selfishness<br />Almost
torn piecemeal.&nbsp; Fools!&nbsp; Gross-hearted fools!<br />These limbs
are God&rsquo;s, not yours: in life for you<br />They spent themselves;
now till the judgment-day<br />By virtue of the Spirit embalmed they
lie&mdash;<br />Touch them who dare.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Would you find
your Saint,<br />Look up, not down, where even now she prays<br />Beyond
that blazing orb for you and me.<br />Why hither bring her corpse?&nbsp;
Why hide her clay<br />In jewelled ark beneath God&rsquo;s mercy-seat&mdash;<br />A
speck of dust among these boundless aisles,<br />Uprushing pillars,
star-bespangled roofs,<br />Whose colours mimic Heaven&rsquo;s unmeasured
blue,<br />Save to remind you, how she is not here,<br />But risen with
Him that rose, and by His blaze<br />Absorbed, lives in the God for
whom she died?<br />Know her no more according to the flesh;<br />Or
only so, to brand upon your thoughts<br />How she was once a woman&mdash;flesh
and blood,<br />Like you&mdash;yet how unlike!&nbsp; Hark while I tell
ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; How liked the mob all this?&nbsp; They hate
him sore.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Half awed, half sullen, till his golden lips<br />Entranced
all ears with tales so sad and strange,<br />They seemed one life-long
miracle: bliss and woe,<br />Honour and shame&mdash;her daring&mdash;Heaven&rsquo;s
stern guidance,<br />Did each the other so outblaze.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Great signs<br />Did wait on her from youth.</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; There went a tale<br />Of one, a Zingar wizard,
who, on her birthnight,<br />He here in Eisenach, she in Presburg lying,<br />Declared
her natal moment, and the glory<br />Which should befall her by the
grace of God.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; He spoke of that, and many a wonder more,<br />Melting
all hearts to worship&mdash;how a robe<br />Which from her shoulders,
at a royal feast,<br />To some importunate as alms she sent,<br />By
miracle within her bower was hung again:<br />And how on her own couch
the Incarnate Son<br />In likeness of a leprous serf, she laid:<br />And
many a wondrous tale till now unheard;<br />Which, from her handmaid&rsquo;s
oath and attestation,<br />Siegfried of Maintz to far Perugia sent,<br />And
sainted Umbria&rsquo;s labyrinthine hills,<br />Even to the holy Council,
where the Patriarchs<br />Of Antioch and Jerusalem, and with them<br />A
host of prelates, magnates, knights, and nobles,<br />Decreed and canonised
her sainthood&rsquo;s palm.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Mass, they could do no less.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; So thought my master&mdash;<br />For &lsquo;Thus,&rsquo;
quoth he, &lsquo;the primates of the Faith<br />Have, in the bull which
late was read to you,<br />Most wisely ratified the will of God<br />Revealed
in her life&rsquo;s splendour; for the next count&mdash;<br />These
miracles wherewith since death she shines&mdash;<br />Since ye must
have your signs, ere ye believe,<br />And since without such tests the
Roman Father<br />Allows no saints to take their seats in heaven,<br />Why,
there ye have them; not a friar, I find,<br />Or old wife in the streets,
but counts some dozens<br />Of blind, deaf, halt, dumb, palsied, and
hysterical,<br />Made whole at this her tomb.&nbsp; A corpse or two<br />Was
raised, they say, last week: Will that content you?<br />Will that content
her?&nbsp; Earthworms!&nbsp; Would ye please the dead,<br />Bring sinful
souls, not limping carcases<br />To test her power on; which of you
hath done that?<br />Has any glutton learnt from her to fast?<br />Or
oily burgher dealt away his pelf?<br />Has any painted Jezebel in sackcloth<br />Repented
of her vanities?&nbsp; Your patron?<br />Think ye, that spell and flame
of intercession,<br />Melting God&rsquo;s iron will, which for your
sakes<br />She purchased by long agonies, was but meant<br />To save
your doctors&rsquo; bills?&nbsp; If any soul<br />Hath been by her made
holier, let it speak!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Well spoken, Legate!&nbsp; Easier asked than
answered.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Not so, for on the moment, from the crowd<br />Sprang
out a gay and gallant gentleman<br />Well known in fight and tourney,
and aloud<br />With sobs and blushes told, how he long time<br />Had
wallowed deep in mire of fleshly sin,<br />And loathed, and fell again,
and loathed in vain;<br />Until the story of her saintly grace<br />Drew
him unto her tomb; there long prostrate<br />With bitter cries he sought
her, till at length<br />The image of her perfect loveliness<br />Transfigured
all his soul, and from his knees<br />He rose new-born, and, since that
blessed day,<br />In chastest chivalry, a spotless knight,<br />Maintains
the widow&rsquo;s and the orphan&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Well done! and what said Conrad?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Oh, he smiled,<br />As who should say, &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas
but the news I looked for.&rsquo;<br />Then, pointing to the banners
borne on high,<br />Where the sad story of her nightly penance<br />Was
all too truly painted&mdash;&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he cried,<br />&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas
thus she schooled her soft and shuddering flesh<br />To dare and suffer
for you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Gay ladies sighed,<br />And stern knights wept,
and growled, and wept again.<br />And then he told her alms, her mighty
labours,<br />Among God&rsquo;s poor, the schools wherein she taught;<br />The
babes she brought to the font, the hospitals<br />Founded from her own
penury, where she tended<br />The leper and the fever-stricken serf<br />With
meanest office; how a dying slave<br />Who craved in vain for milk she
stooped to feed<br />From her own bosom.&nbsp; At that crowning tale<br />Of
utter love, the dullest hearts caught fire<br />Contagious from his
lips&mdash;the Spirit&rsquo;s breath<br />Low to the earth, like dewy-laden
corn,<br />Bowed the ripe harvest of that mighty host;<br />Knees bent,
all heads were bare; rich dames aloud<br />Bewailed their cushioned
sloth; old foes held out<br />Long parted hands; low murmured vows and
prayers<br />Gained courage, till a shout proclaimed her saint,<br />And
jubilant thunders shook the ringing air,<br />Till birds dropped stunned,
and passing clouds bewept<br />With crystal drops, like sympathising
angels,<br />Those wasted limbs, whose sainted ivory round<br />Shed
Eden-odours: from his royal head<br />The Kaiser took his crown, and
on the bier<br />Laid the rich offering; dames tore off their jewels&mdash;<br />Proud
nobles heaped with gold and gems her corse<br />Whom living they despised:
I saw no more&mdash;<br />Mine eyes were blinded with a radiant mist&mdash;<br />And
I ran here to tell you.</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Oh, fair olive,<br />Rich with the Spirit&rsquo;s
unction, how thy boughs<br />Rain balsams on us!</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Thou didst sell thine all&mdash;<br />And bought&rsquo;st
the priceless pearl!</p>
<p><i>1st Monk</i>.&nbsp; Thou holocaust of Abel,<br />By Cain in vain
despised!</p>
<p><i>2d Monk</i>.&nbsp; Thou angels&rsquo; playmate<br />Of yore, but
now their judge!</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Thou alabaster,<br />Broken at last, to fill the
house of God<br />With rich celestial fragrance!</p>
<p>[Etc. etc., ad libitum.]</p>

<p>A room in a convent at Mayence.&nbsp; Conrad alone.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; The work is done!&nbsp; Diva Elizabeth!<br />And
I have trained one saint before I die!<br />Yet now &rsquo;tis done,
is&rsquo;t well done?&nbsp; On my lips<br />Is triumph: but what echo
in my heart?<br />Alas! the inner voice is sad and dull,<br />Even at
the crown and shout of victory.<br />Oh! I had hugged this purpose to
my heart,<br />Cast by for it all ruth, all pride, all scruples;<br />Yet
now its face, that seemed as pure as crystal,<br />Shows fleshly, foul,
and stained with tears and gore!<br />We make, and moil, like children
in their gardens,<br />And spoil with dabbled hands, our flowers i&rsquo;
the planting.<br />And yet a saint is made!&nbsp; Alas, those children!<br />Was
there no gentler way?&nbsp; I know not any:<br />I plucked the gay moth
from the spider&rsquo;s web;<br />What if my hasty hand have smirched
its feathers?<br />Sure, if the whole be good, each several part<br />May
for its private blots forgiveness gain,<br />As in man&rsquo;s tabernacle,
vile elements<br />Unite to one fair stature.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll gainsay
it?<br />The whole is good; another saint in heaven;<br />Another bride
within the Bridegroom&rsquo;s arms;<br />And she will pray for me!&mdash;And
yet what matter?<br />Better that I, this paltry sinful unit,<br />Fall
fighting, crushed into the nether pit,<br />If my dead corpse may bridge
the path to Heaven,<br />And damn itself, to save the souls of others.<br />A
noble ruin: yet small comfort in it;<br />In it, or in aught else&mdash;&mdash;<br />A
blank dim cloud before mine inward sense<br />Dulls all the past: she
spoke of such a cloud&mdash;<br />I struck her for&rsquo;t, and said
it was a fiend&mdash;<br />She&rsquo;s happy now, before the throne
of God&mdash;<br />I should be merry; yet my heart&rsquo;s floor sinks<br />As
on a fast day; sure some evil bodes.<br />Would it were here, that I
might see its eyes!<br />The future only is unbearable!<br />We quail
before the rising thunderstorm<br />Which thrills and whispers in the
stifled air,<br />Yet blench not, when it falls.&nbsp; Would it were
here!</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p>I fain would sleep, yet dare not: all the air<br />Throngs thick
upon me with the pregnant terror<br />Of life unseen, yet near.&nbsp;
I dare not meet them,<br />As if I sleep I shall do&mdash;I again?<br />What
matter what I feel, or like, or fear?<br />Come what God sends.&nbsp;
Within there&mdash;Brother Gerard!</p>
<p>[Gerard enters.]</p>
<p>Watch here an hour, and pray.&mdash;The fiends are busy.<br />So&mdash;hold
my hand.&nbsp; [Crosses himself.]&nbsp; Come on, I fear you not.&nbsp;
[Sleeps.]</p>
<p>[Gerard sings.]</p>
<p>Qui fugiens rnundi gravia<br />Contempsit carnis bravia,<br />Cupidinisque
somnia,<br />Lucratur, perdens, omnia.</p>
<p>Hunc gestant ulnis angeli,<br />Ne lapis officiat pedi;<br />Ne luce
timor occupet,<br />Aut nocte pestis incubet.</p>
<p>Huic c&oelig;li lilia germinant;<br />Arrisus sponsi permanent;<br />Ac
nomen in fidelibus<br />Quam filiorum medius.&nbsp; [Sleeps.]</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p><i>Conrad</i> [awaking].&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; Spirits, stay!&nbsp; Art
thou a hell-born phantasm,<br />Or word too true, sent by the mother
of God?<br />Oh, tell me, queen of Heaven!<br />O God! if she, the city
of the Lord,<br />Who is the heart, the brain, the ruling soul<br />Of
half the earth; wherein all kingdoms, laws,<br />Authority, and faith
do culminate,<br />And draw from her their sanction and their use;<br />The
lighthouse founded on the rock of ages,<br />Whereto the Gentiles look,
and still are healed;<br />The tree whose rootlets drink of every river,<br />Whose
boughs drop Eden fruits on seaward isles;<br />Christ&rsquo;s seamless
coat, rainbowed with gems and hues<br />Of all degrees and uses, rend,
and tarnish,<br />And crumble into dust!<br />Vanitas vanitatum, omnia
vanitas!<br />Oh! to have prayed, and toiled&mdash;and lied&mdash;for
this!<br />For this to have crushed out the heart of youth,<br />And
sat by calm, while living bodies burned!<br />How!&nbsp; Gerard; sleeping!<br />Couldst
thou not watch with me one hour, my son?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>. [awaking].&nbsp; How! have I slept?&nbsp; Shame on my
vaporous brain!<br />And yet there crept along my hand from thine<br />A
leaden languor, and the drowsy air<br />Teemed thick with humming wings&mdash;I
slept perforce.<br />Forgive me (while for breach of holy rule<br />Due
penance shall seem honour) my neglect.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; I should have beat thee for&rsquo;t, an hour agone&mdash;<br />Now
I judge no man.&nbsp; What are rules and methods?<br />I have seen things
which make my brain-sphere reel:<br />My magic teraph-bust, full-packed,
and labelled,<br />With saws, ideas, dogmas, ends, and theories,<br />Lies
shivered into dust.&nbsp; Pah! we do squint<br />Each through his loophole,
and then dream, broad heaven<br />Is but the patch we see.&nbsp; But
let none know;<br />Be silent, Gerard, wary.</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;I know nought<br />Of that which moves
thee: though I fain would ask&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; I saw our mighty Mother, Holy Church,<br />Sit
like a painted harlot: round her limbs<br />An oily snake had coiled,
who smiled, and smiled,<br />And lisped the name of Jesus&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
not tell thee:<br />I have seen more than man can see, and live:<br />God,
when He grants the tree of knowledge, bans<br />The luckless seer from
off the tree of life,<br />Lest he become as gods, and burst with pride;<br />Or
sick at sight of his own nothingness,<br />Lie down, and be a fiend:
my time is near:<br />Well&mdash;I have neither child, nor kin, nor
friend,<br />Save thee, my son; I shall go lightly forth.<br />Thou
knowest we start for Marpurg on the morrow?<br />Thou wilt go with me?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; Ay, to death, my master;<br />Yet boorish heretics,
with grounded throats,<br />Mutter like sullen bulls; the Count of Saym,<br />And
many gentlemen, they say, have sworn<br />A fearful oath: there&rsquo;s
danger in the wind.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; They have their quarrel; I was keen and hasty:<br />Gladio
qui utitur, peribit gladio.<br />When Heaven is strong, then Hell is
strong: Thou fear&rsquo;st not?</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; No! though their name were legion!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
for thee<br />Alone I quake, lest by some pious boldness<br />Thou quench
the light of Israel.</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; Light? my son!<br />There shall no light be quenched,
when I lie dark.<br />Our path trends outward: we will forth to-morrow.<br />Now
let&rsquo;s to chapel; matin bells are ringing.&nbsp; [Exeunt.]</p>

<h3>SCENE III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A road between Eisenach and Marpurg.&nbsp; Peasants waiting by the
roadside.&nbsp; Walter of Varila, the Count of Saym, and other gentlemen
entering on horseback.</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; Talk not of honour&mdash;Hell&rsquo;s aflame within
me:<br />Foul water quenches fire as well as fair;<br />If I do meet
him he shall die the death,<br />Come fair, come foul: I tell you, there
are wrongs<br />The fumbling piecemeal law can never touch,<br />Which
bring of themselves to the injured, right divine,<br />Straight from
the fount of right, above all parchments,<br />To be their own avengers:
dainty lawyers,<br />If one shall slay the adulterer in the act,<br />Dare
not condemn him: girls have stabbed their tyrants,<br />And common sense
has crowned them saints; yet what&mdash;<br />What were their wrongs
to mine?&nbsp; All gone!&nbsp; All gone!<br />My noble boys, whom I
had trained, poor fools,<br />To win their spurs, and ride afield with
me!<br />I could have spared them&mdash;but my wife! my lady!<br />Those
dainty limbs, which no eyes but mine&mdash;<br />Before that ruffian
mob&mdash;Too much for man!<br />Too much, stern Heaven!&mdash;Those
eyes, those hands,<br />Those tender feet, where I have lain and worshipped&mdash;<br />Food
for fierce flames!&nbsp; And on the self-same day&mdash;<br />The day
that they were seized&mdash;unheard&mdash;unargued&mdash;<br />No witness,
but one vile convicted thief&mdash;<br />The dog is dead and buried:
Well done, henchmen!<br />They are not buried!&nbsp; Pah! their ashes
flit<br />About the common air; we pass them&mdash;breathe them!<br />The
self-same day!&nbsp; If I had had one look!<br />One word&mdash;one
single tiny spark of word,<br />Such as two swallows change upon the
wing!<br />She was no heretic: she knelt for ever<br />Before the blessed
rood, and prayed for me.<br />Art sure he comes this road?</p>
<p><i>C. Saym</i>.&nbsp; My messenger<br />Saw him start forth, and
watched him past the crossways.<br />An hour will bring him here.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; How! ambuscading?<br />I&rsquo;ll not sit by,
while helpless priests are butchered.<br />Shame, gentles!</p>
<p><i>C. Saym</i>.&nbsp; On my word, I knew not on&rsquo;t<br />Until
this hour; my quarrel&rsquo;s not so sharp,<br />But I may let him pass:
my name is righted<br />Before the Emperor, from all his slanders;<br />And
what&rsquo;s revenge to me?</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; Ay, ay&mdash;forgive and forget&mdash;<br />The
vermin&rsquo;s trapped&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll be gentle-handed,<br />And
lift him out, and bid his master speed him,<br />Him and his firebrands.&nbsp;
He shall never pass me.</p>
<p><i>C. Wal</i>.&nbsp; I will not see it; I&rsquo;m old, and sick of
blood.<br />She loved him, while she lived; and charged me once,<br />As
her sworn liegeman, not to harm the knave.<br />I&rsquo;ll home: yet,
knights, if aught untoward happen,<br />And you should need a shelter,
come to me:<br />My walls are strong.&nbsp; Home, knaves! we&rsquo;ll
seek our wives,<br />And beat our swords to ploughshares&mdash;when
folks let us.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Count Walter and suite.]</p>
<p><i>C. Saym</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone, brave heart!&mdash;But&mdash;sir,
you will not dare?<br />The Pope&rsquo;s own Legate&mdash;think&mdash;there&rsquo;s
danger in&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; Look, how athwart yon sullen sleeping flats<br />That
frowning thunder-cloud sails pregnant hither;&mdash;<br />And black
against its sheeted gray, one bird<br />Flags fearful onward&mdash;&rsquo;Tis
his cursed soul!<br />Now thou shalt quake, raven!&mdash;The self-same
day!&mdash;<br />He cannot &rsquo;scape!&nbsp; The storm is close upon
him!<br />There!&nbsp; There! the wreathing spouts have swallowed him!<br />He&rsquo;s
gone! and see, the keen blue spark leaps out<br />From crag to crag,
and every vaporous pillar<br />Shouts forth his death-doom!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
a sign, a sign!</p>
<p>[A heretic preacher mounts a stone.&nbsp; Peasants gather round him.]</p>
<p>These are the starved unlettered hinds, forsooth,<br />He hunted
down like vermin&mdash;for a doctrine.<br />They have their rights,
their wrongs; their lawless laws,<br />Their witless arguings, which
unconscious reason<br />Informs to just conclusions.&nbsp; We will hear
them.</p>
<p><i>Preacher</i>.&nbsp; My brethren, I have a message to you: therefore
hearken with all your ears&mdash;for now is the day of salvation.&nbsp;
It is written, that the children of this world are in their generation
wiser than the children of light&mdash;and truly: for the children of
this world, when they are troubled with vermin, catch them&mdash;and
hear no more of them.&nbsp; But you, the children of light, the elect
saints, the poor of this world rich in faith, let the vermin eat your
lives out, and then fall down and worship them afterwards.&nbsp; You
are all besotted&mdash;hag-ridden&mdash;drunkards sitting in the stocks,
and bowing down to the said stocks, and making a god thereof.&nbsp;
Of part, said the prophet, ye make a god, and part serveth to roast&mdash;to
roast the flesh of your sons and of your daughters; and then ye cry,
&lsquo;Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire;&rsquo; and a special fire
ye have seen!&nbsp; The ashes of your wives and of your brothers cleave
to your clothes,&mdash;Cast them up to Heaven, cry aloud, and quit yourselves
like men!</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; He speaks God&rsquo;s truth!&nbsp; We are Heaven&rsquo;s
justicers!&nbsp; Our woes anoint us kings!&nbsp; Peace&mdash;Hark again!&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Preacher</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, as said before&mdash;in the next
place&mdash;It is written, that there shall be a two-edged sword in
the hand of the saints.&nbsp; But the saints have but two swords&mdash;Was
there a sword or shield found among ten thousand in Israel?&nbsp; Then
let Israel use his fists, say I, the preacher!&nbsp; For this man hath
shed blood, and by man shall his blood be shed.&nbsp; Now behold an
argument,&mdash;This man hath shed blood, even Conrad; ergo, as he saith
himself, ye, if ye are men, shall shed his blood.&nbsp; Doth he not
himself say ergo?&nbsp; Hath he not said ergo to the poor saints, to
your sons and your daughters, whom he hath burned in the fire to Moloch?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ergo, thou art a heretic&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ergo, thou shalt
burn.&rsquo;&nbsp; Is he not therefore convicted out of his own mouth?&nbsp;
Arise, therefore, be valiant&mdash;for this day he is delivered into
your hand!</p>
<p>[Chanting heard in the distance.]</p>
<p><i>Peasant</i>.&nbsp; Hush! here the psalm-singers come!</p>
<p>[Conrad enters on a mule, chanting the Psalter, Gerard following.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; My peace with you, my children!</p>
<p><i>1st Voice</i>.&nbsp; Psalm us no psalms; bless us no devil&rsquo;s
blessings:<br />Your balms will break our heads.&nbsp; [A murmur rises.]</p>
<p><i>2d Voice</i>.&nbsp; You are welcome, sir; we are a-waiting for
you.</p>
<p><i>3d Voice</i>.&nbsp; Has he been shriven to-day?</p>
<p><i>4th Voice</i>.&nbsp; Where is your ergo, Master Conrad?&nbsp;
Faugh!<br />How both the fellows smell of smoke!</p>
<p><i>5th Voice</i>.&nbsp; A strange leech he, to suck, and suck, and
suck,<br />And look no fatter for&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><i>Old Woman</i>.&nbsp; Give me back my sons!</p>
<p><i>Old Man</i>.&nbsp; Give me back the light of mine eyes,<br />Mine
only daughter!<br />My only one!&nbsp; He hurled her over the cliffs!<br />Avenge
me, lads; you are young!</p>
<p><i>4th Voice</i>.&nbsp; We will, we will: why smit&rsquo;st him not,
thou with the pole-axe?</p>
<p><i>3d Voice</i>.&nbsp; Nay, now, the first blow costs most, and heals
last;<br />Besides, the dog&rsquo;s a priest at worst.</p>
<p><i>C. Saym</i>.&nbsp; Mass!&nbsp; How the shaveling rascal stands
at bay!<br />There&rsquo;s not a rogue of them dare face his eye!<br />True
Domini canes!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ware the bloodhound&rsquo;s teeth, curs!</p>
<p><i>Preacher</i>.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Are ye afraid?&nbsp; The huntsman&rsquo;s
here at last<br />Without his whip!&nbsp; Down with him, craven hounds!<br />I&rsquo;ll
help ye to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; [Springs from the stone.]</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; Ay, down with him!&nbsp; Mass, have these yelping
boors<br />More heart than I?&nbsp; [Spurs his horse forward.]</p>
<p><i>Mob</i>.&nbsp; A knight! a champion!</p>
<p><i>Voice</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not mortal man!<br />See how his eyes
shine!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the archangel!<br />St. Michael come to the
rescue!&nbsp; Ho!&nbsp; St. Michael!</p>
<p>[He lunges at Conrad.&nbsp; Gerard turns the lance aside, and throws
his arms round Conrad.]</p>
<p><i>Ger</i>.&nbsp; My master! my master!&nbsp; The chariot of Israel
and the horses thereof!<br />Oh call down fire from Heaven!</p>
<p>[A peasant strikes down Gerard.&nbsp; Conrad, over the body.]</p>
<p>Alas! my son!&nbsp; This blood shall cry for vengeance<br />Before
the throne of God!</p>
<p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; And cry in vain!<br />Follow thy minion!&nbsp;
Join Folquet in hell!</p>
<p>[Bears Conrad down on his lance-point.]</p>
<p><i>Con</i>.&nbsp; I am the vicar of the Vicar of Christ:<br />Who
touches me doth touch the Son of God.</p>
<p>[The mob close over him.]</p>
<p>O God!&nbsp; A martyr&rsquo;s crown!&nbsp; Elizabeth!&nbsp; [Dies.]</p>

Books concerning Saint Elizabeth, by Dietrich the Thuringian</i>; in
Basnage&rsquo;s <i>Canisius</i>, Vol. IV. p. 113 (Antwerp; 1725).</p>
<p>Page 21.&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I. &sect; 3.&nbsp; Dietrich is eloquent about
her youthful inclination for holy places, and church doors, even when
shut, and gives many real proofs of her &lsquo;sanct&aelig; indolis,&rsquo;
from the very cradle.</p>
<p>P. 22.&nbsp; &lsquo;St. John&rsquo;s sworn maid.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf.
Lib. I. &sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;She chose by lot for her patron, St.
John the protector of virginity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fit for my princess.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
I. &sect; 2.&nbsp; &lsquo;He sent with his daughter vessels of gold,
silver baths, jewels, <i>pillows all of silk</i>.&nbsp; No such things,
so precious or so many, were ever seen in Thuringen-land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 23.&nbsp; &lsquo;Most friendless.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I. &sect;&sect;
5, 6.&nbsp; &lsquo;The courtiers used bitterly to insult her, etc.&nbsp;
Her mother and sister-in-law, given to worldly pomp, differed from her
exceedingly;&rsquo; and much more concerning &lsquo;the persecutions
which she endured patiently in youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;In one cradle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I.
&sect; 2.&nbsp; &lsquo;The princess was laid in the cradle of her boy-spouse,&rsquo;
and, says another, &lsquo;the infants embraced with smiles, from whence
the bystanders drew a joyful omen of their future happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;If thou love him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
I. &sect; 6.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord by His hidden inspiration so inclined
towards her the heart of the prince, that in the solitude of secret
and mutual love he used to speak sweetly to her heart, with kindness
and consolation, and was always wont, on returning home, to honour her
with presents, and soothe her with embraces.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was their
custom, says Dietrich, to the last to call each other in common conversation
&lsquo;Brother&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 24.&nbsp; &lsquo;To his charge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I. &sect;

<p>P. 27.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stadings.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Stadings, according
to Fleury, in A.D. 1233, were certain unruly fenmen, who refused to
pay tithes, committed great cruelties on religious of both sexes, worshipped,
or were said to worship, a black cat, etc., considered the devil as
a very ill-used personage, and the rightful lord of themselves and the
world, and were of the most profligate morals.&nbsp; An impartial and
philosophic investigation of this and other early continental heresies
is much wanted.</p>
<p>P. 37.&nbsp; &lsquo;All gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I. &sect; 7,

<p>Hitherto my notes have been a careful selection of the few grains
of characteristic fact which I could find among Dietrich&rsquo;s lengthy
professional reflections; but the chapter on which this scene is founded
is remarkable enough to be given whole, and as I have a long-standing
friendship for the good old monk, who is full of honest na&iuml;vet&eacute;
and deep-hearted sympathy, and have no wish to disgust <i>all</i> my
readers with him, I shall give it for the most part untranslated.&nbsp;
In the meantime those who may be shocked at certain expressions in this
poem, borrowed from the Romish devotional school, may verify my language
at the Romish booksellers, who find just now a rapidly increasing sale
for such ware.&nbsp; And is it not after all a hopeful sign for the
age that even the most questionable literary tastes must nowadays ally
themselves with religion&mdash;that the hotbed imaginations which used
to batten on Rousseau and Byron have now risen at least as high as the
<i>Vies des Saints</i> and St. Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales&rsquo; Philothea?&nbsp;
The truth is, that in such a time as this, in the dawn of an age of
faith, whose future magnificence we may surely prognosticate from the
slowness and complexity of its self-developing process, spiritual &lsquo;Werterism,&rsquo;
among other strange prolusions, must have its place.&nbsp; The emotions
and the imaginations will assert their just right to be fed&mdash;by
foul means if not by fair; and even self-torture will have charms after
the utter dryness and life-in-death of mere ecclesiastical pedantry.&nbsp;
It is good, mournful though it be, that a few, even by gorging themselves
with poison, should indicate the rise of a spiritual hunger&mdash;if
we do but take their fate as a warning to provide wholesome food before
the new craving has extended itself to the many.&nbsp; It is good that
religion should have its Werterism, in order that hereafter Werterism
may have its religion.&nbsp; But to my quotations&mdash;wherein the
reader will judge how difficult it has been for me to satisfy at once
the delicacy of the English mind and that historic truth which the highest
art demands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Erat inter eos honorabile connubium, et thorus immaculatus,
non in ardore libidmis, sed in conjugalis sanctimoni&aelig; castitate.&nbsp;
For the holy maiden, as soon as she was married, began to macerate her
flesh with many watchings, rising every night to pray; her husband sometimes
sleeping, sometimes conniving at her, often begging her, in compassion
to her delicacy, not to afflict herself indiscreetly, often supporting
her with his hand when she prayed.&rsquo;&nbsp; (&lsquo;And,&rsquo;
says another of her biographers, &lsquo;being taught by her to pray
with her.&rsquo;)&nbsp; &lsquo;Great truly, was the devotion of this
young girl, who, rising from the bed of her carnal husband, sought Christ,
whom she loved as the <i>true husband of her soul.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor certainly was there less faith in the husband who did
not oppose such and so great a wife, but rather favoured her, and tempered
her fervour with over-kind prudence.&nbsp; Affected, therefore, by the
sweetness of this modest love, and mutual society, they could not bear
to be separated for any length of time or distance.&nbsp; The lady,
therefore, frequently followed her husband through rough roads, and
no small distances, and severe wind and weather, led rather by emotions
of sincerity than of carnality: <i>for the chaste presence of a modest
husband offered no obstacle to that devout spouse in the way of praying,
watching, or otherwise doing good</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then follows the story of her nurse waking Lewis instead of her,
and Lewis&rsquo;s easy good-nature about this, as about every other
event of life.&nbsp; &lsquo;And so, after these unwearied watchings,
it often happened that, praying for an excessive length of time, she
fell asleep on a mat beside her husband&rsquo;s bed, and being reproved
for it by her maidens, answered: &ldquo;Though I cannot always pray,
yet I can do violence to my own flesh by tearing myself in the meantime
from my couch.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fugiebat oblectamenta carnalia, et ide&ograve; stratum molliorem,

Quem quamvis pr&aelig;cordialis amoris affectu deligeret, querulabatur
tamen dolens, quod virginalis decorem floris non meruit conservare</i>.&nbsp;
Castigabat etiam plagis multis, et lacerabat diris verberibus carnem
puella innocens et pudica.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In principio quidem diebus quadragesim&aelig;, sextisque feriis
aliis occultas solebat accipere disciplinas, l&aelig;tam coram hominibus

make a vow of obedience and continence at the will of the said Conrad,
<i>salv&acirc; jure matrimonii</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 59.&nbsp; &lsquo;The open street.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. II. &sect;
11.&nbsp; &lsquo;On the Rogation days, when certain persons doing contrary
to the decrees of the saints are decorated with precious and luxurious
garments, the Princess, dressed in serge and barefooted, used to follow
most devoutly the Procession of the Cross and the relics of the Saints,
and place herself always at sermon among the poorest women; knowing
(says Dietrich) that seeds cast into the valleys spring up into the
richest crop of corn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 60.&nbsp; &lsquo;The poor of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. II.
&sect;&sect; 6, 11, <i>et passim</i>.&nbsp; Elizabeth&rsquo;s labours
among the poor are too well known throughout one half at least of Christendom,
where she is, <i>par excellence</i>, the patron of the poor, to need
quotations.</p>
<p>P. 61.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be thy pupil.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
II &sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;She used also, by words and examples, to oblige
the worldly ladies who came to her to give up the vanity of the world,
at least in some one particular.&rsquo;</p>

su&aelig;</i> diebus, used to dress herself in serge, and, taking in
her arms her new-born child, used to go forth secretly, barefooted,
by the difficult descent from the castle, by a rough and rocky road
to a remote church, carrying her infant in her own arms, after the example
of the Virgin Mother, and offering him upon the altar to the Lord with
a taper&rsquo; (and with gold, says another biographer).</p>
<p>P. 71.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give us bread.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. III. &sect;
6.&nbsp; &lsquo;A.D. 1225, while the Landgrave was gone to Italy to
the Emperor, a severe famine arose throughout all Almaine; and lasting
for nearly two years, destroyed many with hunger.&nbsp; Then Elizabeth,
moved with compassion for the miserable, collected all the corn from
her granaries, and distributed it as alms for the poor.&nbsp; She also
built a hospital at the foot of the Wartburg, wherein she placed all
those who could not wait for the general distribution. . . .&nbsp; She
sold her own ornaments to feed the members of Christ. . . .&nbsp; Cuidam
misero lac desideranti, ad mulgendum se pr&aelig;buit!&rsquo;&mdash;See

III. &sect; 8.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the courtiers and stewards complained
on his return of the Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s too great extravagance in
almsgiving, &ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;to do good,
and to give whatever she will for God&rsquo;s sake, only keep Wartburg
and Neuenberg in my hands.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 87.&nbsp; &lsquo;A crusader&rsquo;s cross.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
IV. &sect; 1.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the year 1227 there was a general &ldquo;Passagium&rdquo;
to the Holy Land, in which Frederick the Emperor also crossed the seas&rsquo;
(or rather did <i>not</i> cross the seas, says Heinrich Stero, in his
annals, but having got as far as Sicily, came back again&mdash;miserably
disappointing and breaking up the expedition, whereof the greater part
died at the various ports&mdash;and was excommunicated for so doing);
&lsquo;and Lewis, landgrave of the Thuringians, took the cross likewise
in the name of Jesus Christ, and . . . did not immediately fix the badge
which he had received to his garment, as the matter is, lest his wife,
who loved him with the most tender affection, seeing this, should be
anxious and disturbed, . . . but she found it while turning over his
purse, and fainted, struck down with a wonderful consternation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 90.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must be gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. IV. &sect;
2.&nbsp; A chapter in which Dietrich rises into a truly noble and pathetic
strain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Coming to Schmalcald,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Lewis
found his dearest friends, whom he had ordered to meet him there, not
wishing to depart without taking leave of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then follows Dietrich&rsquo;s only poetic attempt, which Basnage
calls a &lsquo;<i>carmen ineptum</i>, foolish ballad,&rsquo; and most
unfairly, as all readers should say, if I had any hope of doing justice
in a translation to this genial fragment of an old dramatic ballad,
and its simple objectivity, as of a writer so impressed (like all true
Teutonic poets in those earnest days) with the pathos and greatness
of his subject that he never tries to &lsquo;improve&rsquo; it by reflections
and preaching at his readers, but thinks it enough just to tell his
story, sure that it will speak for itself to all hearts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Surely there is a heart of flesh in the old monk which, when warmed
by a really healthy subject, can toss aside Scripture parodies and professional
Stoic sentiment, and describe with such life and pathos, like any eye-witness,
a scene which occurred, in fact, two years before his birth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And thus this <i>Prince of Peace</i>, &lsquo;he continues,
&lsquo;mounting his horse with many knights, etc. . . . about the end
of the month of June, set forth in the name of the Lord, praising him
in heart and voice, and weeping and singing were heard side by side.&nbsp;
And close by followed, with saddest heart, that most faithful lady after
her sweetest prince, her most loving spouse, never, alas! to behold
him more.&nbsp; And when she was going to return, the force of love
and the agony of separation forced her on with him one day&rsquo;s journey:
and yet that did not suffice.&nbsp; She went on, still unable to bear
the parting, another full day&rsquo;s journey. . . . At last they part,
at the exhortations of Rudolph the Cupbearer.&nbsp; What groans, think
you, what sobs, what struggles, and yearnings of the heart must there
have been?&nbsp; Yet they part, and go on their way. . . .&nbsp; The
lord went forth exulting, as a giant to run his course; the lady returned
lamenting, as a widow, and tears were on her cheeks.&nbsp; Then putting
off the garments of joy, she took the dress of widowhood.&nbsp; The
mistress of nations, sitting alone, she turned herself utterly to God&mdash;to
her former good works, adding better ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their children were &lsquo;Hermann, who became Landgraf; a daughter
who married the Duke of Brabant; another, who, remaining in virginity,
became a nun of Aldenburg, of which place she is Lady Abbess until this
day.&rsquo;</p>

&ldquo;The world is dead to me, and all that is pleasant in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Having said this, suddenly springing up with tears, she rushed swiftly
through the whole length of the palace, and being entirely beside herself,
would have run on to the world&rsquo;s end, <i>usque qu&acirc;que</i>,
if a wall had not stopped her; and others coming up, led her away from

<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yon lion&rsquo;s rage.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf.
Lib. III. &sect; 2.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was a certain lion in the court
of the Prince; and it came to pass on a time that rising from his bed
in the morning, and crossing the court dressed only in his gown and
slippers, he met this lion loose and raging against him.&nbsp; He thereon
threatened the beast with his raised fist, and rated it manfully, till
laying aside its fierceness, it lay down at the knight&rsquo;s feet,

<p>&lsquo;Now shortly after the news of Lewis&rsquo;s death, certain
vassals of her late husband (with Henry, her brother-in-law) cast her
out of the castle and of all her possessions. . . . She took refuge
that night in a certain tavern, . . . and went at midnight to the matins
of the &ldquo;Minor Brothers.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; And when no one dare
give her lodging, took refuge in the church. . . .&nbsp; And when her
little ones were brought to her from the castle, amid most bitter frost,
she knew not where to lay their heads. . . . She entered a priest&rsquo;s
house, and fed her family miserably enough, by pawning what she had.&nbsp;
There was in that town an enemy of hers, having a roomy house. . . .&nbsp;
Whither she entered at his bidding, and was forced to dwell with her
whole family in a very narrow space, . . . her host and hostess heaped
her with annoyances and spite.&nbsp; She therefore bade them farewell,
saying, &ldquo;I would willingly thank mankind if they would give me
any reason for so doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she returned to her former
filthy cell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>P 120.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your self imposed vows.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
IV. &sect; I.&nbsp; &lsquo;On Good Friday, when the altars were exhibited
bare in remembrance of the Saviour who hung bare on the cross for us,
she went into a certain chapel, and in the presence of Master Conrad,
and certain Franciscan brothers, laying her holy hands on the bare altar,
renounced her own will, her parents, children, relations, &ldquo;et
omnibus hujus modi pompis,&rdquo; all pomps of this kind (a misprint,
one hopes, for mundi) in imitation of Christ, and &ldquo;omnm&ograve;
se exuit et nudavit,&rdquo; stripped herself utterly naked, to follow
Him naked, in the steps of poverty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>P 124.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thine own needs.&rsquo;&nbsp; But when she was
going to renounce her possessions also, the prudent Conrad stopped her.&nbsp;
The reflections which follow are Dietrich&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>P 125.&nbsp; &lsquo;The likeness of the fiend&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; I
have put this daring expression into Conrad&rsquo;s mouth, as the ideal
outcome of the teaching of Conrad&rsquo;s age on this point&mdash;and
of much teaching also which miscalls itself Protestant, in our own age.&nbsp;
The doctrine is not, of course, to be found <i>totidem verbis</i> in
the formularies of any sect&mdash;yet almost all sects preach it, and
quote Scripture for it as boldly as Conrad&mdash;the Romish Saint alone
carries it honestly out into practice.</p>
<p>P 126.&nbsp; &lsquo;With pine boughs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VI. &sect;
2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Entering a certain desolate court she betook herself,
&ldquo;sub gradu cujusdam caminat&aelig;,&rdquo; to the projection of
a certain furnace, where she roofed herself in with boughs.&nbsp; In
the meantime in the town of Marpurg, was built for her a humble cottage
of clay and timber.&rsquo;</p>

&sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now Conrad as a prudent man, perceiving that
this disciple of Christ wished to arrive at the highest pitch of perfection,
studied to remove all which he thought would retard her, and therefore
drove from her all those of her former household in whom she used to
solace or delight herself.&nbsp; Thus the holy priest deprived this
servant of God of all society, that so the constancy of her obedience
might become known, and occasion might be given to her for clinging
to God alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P 128.&nbsp; &lsquo;A leprous boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VI. &sect;
8.</p>
<p>She had several of these prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, successively, whose
diseases are too disgusting to be specified, on whom she lavished the
most menial cares.&nbsp; All the other stories of her benevolence which
occur in these two pages are related by Dietrich.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mighty to save.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VII.
&sect; 7.&nbsp; When we read amongst other matters, how the objects
of her prayers used to become while she was speaking so intensely <i>hot</i>,
that they not only smoked, and nearly melted, but burnt the fingers
of those who touched them: from whence Dietrich bids us &lsquo;learn
with what an ardour of charity she used to burn, who would dry up with
her heat the flow of worldly desire, and inflame to the love of eternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P 130.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lands and titles&rsquo;.&nbsp; Cf. Lib. V. &sect;&sect;

<p>P 131.&nbsp; &lsquo;Spinning wool.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VI. &sect;
6.&nbsp; &lsquo;And crossing himself for wonder, the Count Pama cried
out and said, &ldquo;Was it ever seen to this day that a king&rsquo;s
daughter should spin wool?&rdquo;&nbsp; All his messages from her father
(says Dietrich) were of no avail.</p>
<p>P 135.&nbsp; &lsquo;To do her penance.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VII.
&sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now he had placed with her certain austere women,
from whom she endured much oppression patiently for Christ&rsquo;s sake
who, watching her rigidly, frequently reported her to her master for
having transgressed her obedience in giving some thing to the poor,
or begging others to give.&nbsp; And when thus accused she often received
many blows from her master, insomuch that he used to strike her in the
face, which she earnestly desired to endure patiently in memory of the
stripes of the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P 136.&nbsp; &lsquo;That she dared not.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VII.
&sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;When her most intimate friends, Isentrudis and
Guta (whom another account describes as in great poverty), &lsquo;came
to see her, she dared not give them anything even for food, nor, without
special licence, salute them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P 137.&nbsp; &lsquo;To bear within us.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Seeing
in the church of certain monks who &ldquo;professed poverty&rdquo; images
sumptuously gilt, she said to about twenty four of them, &ldquo;You
had better to have spent this money on your own food and clothes, for
we ought to have the reality of these images written in our hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if any one mentioned a beautiful image before her she used to say,
&lsquo;I have no need of such an image.&nbsp; I carry the thing itself
in my bosom.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>P 139.&nbsp; &lsquo;My mother rose.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf.&nbsp; Lib. VI
&sect; 8.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her mother, who had been long ago&rsquo; (when
Elizabeth was nine years old) &lsquo;miserably slain by the Hungarians,
appeared to her in her dreams upon her knees, and said, &ldquo;My beloved
child! pray for the agonies which I suffer; for thou canst.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Elizabeth waking, prayed earnestly, and falling asleep again, her mother
appeared to her and told her that she was freed, and that Elizabeth&rsquo;s
prayers would hereafter benefit all who invoked her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
the causes of her mother&rsquo;s murder the less that is said the better,
but the prudent letter which the Bishop of Gran sent back when asked
to join in the conspiracy against her is worthy notice.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Reginam
occidere nolite timere bonum est.&nbsp; Si omnes consentiunt ego non
contradico</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; To be read as a full consent, or as a flat
refusal, according to the success of the plot.</p>
<p>P. 140.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any living soul.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dietrich has much
on this point, headed, &lsquo;How Master Conrad exercised Saint Elizabeth
in the breaking of her own will. . . .&nbsp; And at last forbad her
entirely to give alms; whereon she employed herself in washing lepers
and other infirm folk.&nbsp; In the meantime she was languishing, and
inwardly tortured with emotions of compassion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I may here say that in representing Elizabeth&rsquo;s early death
as accelerated by a &lsquo;broken heart&rsquo; I have, I believe, told
the truth, though I find no hint of anything of the kind in Dietrich.&nbsp;
The religious public of a petty town in the thirteenth century round
the deathbed of a royal saint would of course treasure up most carefully
all incidents connected with her latter days; but they would hardly
record sentiments or expressions which might seem to their notions to
derogate in anyway from her saintship.&nbsp; Dietrich, too, looking
at the subject as a monk and not as a man, would consider it just as
much his duty to make her death-scene rapturous as to make both her
life and her tomb miraculous.&nbsp; I have composed these last scenes
in the belief that Elizabeth and all her compeers will be recognised
as real saints, in proportion as they are felt to have been real men
and women.</p>
<p>P. 142.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eructate sweet doctrine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The expressions
are Dietrich&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;In her coffin yet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
VIII. &sect; I.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;So she said.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. <i>Ibid.</i></p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;The poor of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She
begged her master to distribute all to the poor, except a worthless
tunic in which she wished to be buried.&nbsp; She made no will: she
would have no heir beside Christ&rsquo; (<i>i.e</i>. the poor).</p>
<p>P. 143.&nbsp; &lsquo;Martha, and their brother,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>I have compressed the events of several days into one in this scene.&nbsp;
I give Dietrich&rsquo;s own account, omitting his reflections.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When she had been ill twelve days and more one of her maids sitting
by her bed heard in her throat a very sweet sound, . . . and saying,
&ldquo;Oh, my mistress, how sweetly thou didst sing!&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;I tell thee, I heard a little bird between me and the wall sing
merrily; who with his sweet song so stirred me up that I could not but
sing myself.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, &sect; 3.&nbsp; &lsquo;The last day she remained till evening
most devout, having been made partaker of the celestial table, and inebriated
with that most pure blood of life, which is Christ.&nbsp; The word of
truth was continually on her lips, and opening her mouth of wisdom,
she spake of the best things, which she had heard in sermons; eructating
from her heart good words, and the law of clemency was heard on her
tongue.&nbsp; She told from the abundance of her heart how the Lord
Jesus condescended to console Mary and Martha at the raising again of
their brother Lazarus, and then, speaking of His weeping with them over
the dead, she eructated the memory of the abundance of the Lord&rsquo;s
sweetness, <i>affectu et effectu</i> (in feeling and expression?).&nbsp;
Certain religious person who were present, hearing these words, fired
with devotion by the grace which filled her lips, melted into tears.&nbsp;
To whom the saint of God, now dying, recalled the sweet words of her
Lord as He went to death, saying, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; Having said this she was silent.&nbsp; A wonderful thing.&nbsp;
Then most sweet voices were heard in her throat, without any motion
of her lips; and she asked of those round, &ldquo;Did ye not hear some
singing with me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whereon none of the faithful are
allowed to doubt,&rdquo; says Dietrich, &ldquo;when she herself heard
the harmony of the heavenly hosts,&rdquo; etc. etc. . . . From that
time till twilight she lay, as if exultant and jubilant, showing signs
of remarkable devotion, till the crowing of the cock.&nbsp; Then, as
if secure in the Lord, she said to the bystanders, &ldquo;What should
we do if the fiend showed himself to us?&rdquo;&nbsp; And shortly afterwards,
with a loud and clear voice, &ldquo;Fly! fly!&rdquo; as if repelling
the d&aelig;mon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the cock-crow she said, &ldquo;Here is the hour in which
the Virgin brought forth her child Jesus and laid him in a manger. .
. .&nbsp; Let us talk of Him, and of that new star which he created
by his omnipotence, which never before was seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
these&rdquo; (says Montanus in her name) &ldquo;are the venerable mysteries
of our faith, our richest blessings, our fairest ornaments: in these
all the reason of our hope flourishes, faith grows, charity burns.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The novelty of the style and matter will, I hope, excuse its prolixity
with most readers.&nbsp; If not, I have still my reasons for inserting
the greater part of this chapter.</p>
<p>P. 145.&nbsp; &lsquo; I demand it.&rsquo;&nbsp; How far I am justified
in putting such fears into her mouth the reader may judge.&nbsp; Cf.
Lib. VIII. &sect; 5.&nbsp;  &lsquo;The devotion of the people demanding
it, her body was left unburied till the fourth day in the midst of a
multitude.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;The flesh,&rsquo; says Dietrich, &lsquo;had the tenderness
of a living body, and was easily moved hither and thither at the will
of those who handled it . . . . And many, sublime in the valour of their
faith, tore off the hair of her head and the nails of her fingers (&ldquo;even
the tips of her ears, <i>et mamillarum papillas</i>,&rdquo; says untranslatably
Montanus of Spire), and kept them as relics.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reference
relating to the pictures of her disciplines and the effect which they
produced on the crowd I have unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>P.&nbsp; 146.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet no pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib.
VIII &sect; 4.&nbsp; &lsquo;She said, &ldquo;Though I am weak I feel
no disease or pain,&rdquo; and so through that whole day and night,
as hath been said, having been elevated with most holy affections of
mind towards God, and inflamed in spirit with most divine utterances
and conversations, at length she rested from jubilating, and inclining
her head as if falling into a sweet sleep, expired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 147.&nbsp; &lsquo;Canonisation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VIII. &sect;
10.&nbsp; If I have in the last scene been guilty of a small anachronism,
I have in this been guilty of a great one.&nbsp; Conrad was of course
a prime means of Elizabeth&rsquo;s canonisation, and, as Dietrich and
his own &lsquo;Letter to Pope Gregory the Ninth&rsquo; show, collected,
and pressed on the notice of the Archbishop of Maintz, the miraculous
statements necessary for that honour.&nbsp; But he died two years before
the actual publication of her canonisation.&nbsp; It appeared to me
that by following the exact facts I must either lose sight of the final
triumph, which connects my heroine for ever with Germany and all Romish
Christendom, and is the very culmination of the whole story, or relinquish
my only opportunity of doing Conrad justice, by exhibiting the remaining
side of his character.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I have erred, and that the most strict historic
truth would have coincided, as usual, with the highest artistic effect,
while it would only have corroborated the moral of my poem, supposing
that there is one.&nbsp; But I was fettered by the poverty of my own
imagination, and &lsquo;do manus lectoribus.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Third Minors.&rsquo;&nbsp; The order of
the Third Minors of St. Francis of Assisi was in invention of the comprehensive
mind of that truly great man, by which &lsquo;worldlings&rsquo; were
enabled to participate in the spiritual advantages of the Franciscan
rule and discipline without neglect or suspension of their civic and
family duties.&nbsp; But it was an institution too enlightened for its
age; and family and civic ties were destined for a far nobler consecration.&nbsp;
The order was persecuted and all but exterminated by the jealousy of
the Regular Monks, not, it seems, without papal connivance.&nbsp; Within
a few years after its foundation it numbered amongst its members the
noblest knights and ladies of Christendom, St. Louis of France among
the number.</p>
<p>P. 149.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lest he fall.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Fleury, <i>Eccl.
Annals</i>, in Anno 1233.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doctor Conrad of Marpurg, the
King Henry, son of the Emperor Frederick, etc., called an Assembly at
Mayence to examine persons accused as heretics.&nbsp; Among whom the
Count of Saym demanded a delay to justify himself.&nbsp; As for the
others who did not appear, Conrad gave the cross to those who would
take up arms against them.&nbsp; At which these supposed heretics were
so irritated, that on his return they lay in wait for him near Marpurg,
and killed him, with brother Gerard, of the order of Minors, a holy
man.&nbsp; Conrad was accused of precipitation in his judgments, and
of having burned <i>trop l&eacute;g&egrave;rement</i> under pretext
of heresy, many noble and not noble, monks, nuns, burghers, and peasants.&nbsp;
For he had them executed the same day that they were accused, without
allowing any appeal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 150.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Kaiser.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VIII. &sect;
12, for a list of the worthies present.</p>
<p>P. 151.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Zingar wizard.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. I. &sect;
1.&nbsp; The Magician&rsquo;s name was Klingsohr.&nbsp; He has been
introduced by Novalis into his novel of <i>Heinrich Von Ofterdingen</i>,
as present at the famous contest of the Minnesingers on the Wartburg.&nbsp;
Here is Dietrich&rsquo;s account:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was in those days in the Landgrave&rsquo;s court six
knights, nobles, etc. etc., &ldquo;cantilenarum confectores summi,&rdquo;
song-wrights of the highest excellence&rsquo; (either one of them or
Klingsohr himself was the author of the Nibelungen-lied and the Heldenbuch).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now there dwelt then in the parts of Hungary, in the land
which is called the &ldquo;Seven Castles,&rdquo; a certain rich nobleman,
worth 3000 marks a year, a philosopher, practised from his youth in
secular literature, but nevertheless learned in the sciences of Necromancy
and Astronomy.&nbsp; This master Klingsohr was sent for by the Prince
to judge between the songs of these knights aforesaid.&nbsp; Who, before
he was introduced to the Landgrave, sitting one night in Eisenach, in
the court of his lodging, looked very earnestly upon the stars, and
being asked if he had perceived any secrets, &ldquo;Know that this night
is born a daughter to the King of Hungary, who shall be called Elizabeth,
and shall be a saint, and shall be given to wife to the son of this
prince, in the fame of whose sanctity all the earth shall exult and
be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;See!&mdash;He who by Balaam the wizard foretold the mystery
of his own incarnation, himself foretold by this wizard the name and
birth of his fore-chosen handmaid Elizabeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; (A comparison,
of which Basnage says, that he cannot deny it to be intolerable.)&nbsp;
I am not bound to explain all strange stories, but considering who and
whence Klingsohr was, and the fact that the treaty of espousals took
place two months afterwards, &lsquo;adhuc sugens ubera desponsata est,&rsquo;
it is not impossible that King Andrew and his sage vassal may have had
some previous conversation on the destination of the unborn princess.</p>
<p>P. 151.&nbsp; &lsquo;A robe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. II. &sect; 9,
for this story, on which Dietrich observes, &lsquo;Thus did her Heavenly
Father clothe his lily Elizabeth, as Solomon in all his glory could
not do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 152.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Incarnate Son.&rsquo;&nbsp; This story is
told, I think, by Surias, and has been introduced with an illustration
by a German artist of the highest note, into a modern prose biography
of this saint.&nbsp; (I have omitted much more of the same kind.)</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sainthood&rsquo;s palm.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf.
Lib. VIII. &sect;&sect; 7, 8, 9.&nbsp; &lsquo;While to declare the merits
of his handmaid Elizabeth, in the place where her body rested, Almighty
God was thus multiplying the badges of her virtues (<i>i.e</i>. miracles),
two altars were built in her praise in that chapel, which while Siegfried,
Archbishop of Mayence, was consecrating, as he had evidently been commanded
in a vision, at the prayers of that devout man master Conrad, preacher
of the word of God; the said preacher commanded all who had received
any grace of healing from the merits of Elizabeth, to appear next day
before the Archbishop and faithfully prove their assertions by witnesses.
. . .&nbsp; Then the Most Holy Father, Pope Gregory the Ninth, having
made diligent examination of the miracles transmitted to him, trusting
at the same time to mature and prudent counsels, and the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
providence, above all, so ordaining, his clemency disposing, and his
grace admonishing, decreed that the Blessed Elizabeth was to be written
among the catalogue of the saints on earth, since in heaven she rejoices
as written in the Book of Life.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>Then follow four chapters, headed severally&mdash;</p>
<p>&sect; 9.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of the solemn canonisation of the Blessed
Elizabeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&sect; 10.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of the translation of the Blessed Elizabeth
(and how the corpse when exposed diffused round a miraculous fragrance).&rsquo;</p>
<p>&sect; 11.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of the desire of the people to see, embrace,
and kiss (says Dietrich) those sacred bones, the organs of the Holy
Spirit, from which flowed so many graces of sanctities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&sect; 12.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of the sublime persons who were present,
and their oblations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&sect; 13.&nbsp; &lsquo;A consideration of the divine mercy about
this matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behold! she who despised the glory of the world, and refused
the company of magnates, is magnificently honoured by the dignity of
the Pontifical office, and the reverent care of Imperial Majesty.&nbsp;
And she who, seeking the lowest place in this life, sat on the ground,
slept in the dust, is now raised on high, by the hands of Kings and
Princes. . . . It transcends all heights of temporal glory, to have
been made like the saints in glory.&nbsp; For all the rich among the
people &ldquo;vultum ejus desprecantur&rdquo; (pray for the light of
her countenance), and kings and princes offer gifts, magnates adore
her, and all nations serve her.&nbsp; Nor without reason, for &ldquo;she
sold all and gave to the poor,&rdquo; and counting all her substance
for nothing, bought for herself this priceless pearl of eternity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One would be sorry to believe that such utterly mean considerations
of selfish vanity, expressing as they do an extreme respect for the
very pomps and vanities which they praise the saints for despising,
really went to the making of any saint, Romish or other.</p>
<p>&sect; 14.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of the sacred oil which flowed from the bones
of Elizabeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I subjoin the &lsquo;Epilogus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Moreover even as the elect handmaid of God, the most blessed
Elizabeth, had shone during her life with wonderful signs of her virtues,
so since the day of her blessed departure up to the present time, she
is resplendent through the various quarters of the world with illustrious
prodigies of miracles, the Divine power glorifying her.&nbsp; For to
the blind, dumb, deaf, and lame, dropsical, possessed, and leprous,
shipwrecked, and captives, &ldquo;ipsius mertis,&rdquo; as a reward
for her holy deeds, remedies are conferred.&nbsp; Also, to all diseases,
necessities, and dangers, assistance is given.&nbsp; And, moreover,
by the many corpses, &ldquo;<i>puta sedecim</i>&rdquo; say sixteen,
wonderfully raised to life by herself, becomes known to the faithful
the magnificence of the virtues of the Most High glorifying His saint.&nbsp;
To that Most High be glory and honour for ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So ends Dietrich&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; The reader has by this time,
I hope, read enough to justify, in every sense, Conrad&rsquo;s &lsquo;A
corpse or two was raised, they say, last week,&rsquo; and much more
of the funeral oration which I have put into his mouth.</p>
<p>P. 153.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gallant gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VIII.
&sect; 6.</p>
<p>P. 154.&nbsp; &lsquo;Took his crown.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cf. Lib. VIII.
&sect; 12.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>.&nbsp; The &lsquo;olive&rsquo; and the &lsquo;pearl&rsquo;
are Dietrich&rsquo;s own figures.&nbsp; The others follow the method
of scriptural interpretation, usual in the writers of that age.</p>
<p>P. 162.&nbsp; &lsquo;Domini canes,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s
hounds,&rsquo; a punning sobriquet of the Dominican inquisitors, in
allusion to their profession.</p>
<p>P 163.&nbsp; &lsquo;Folquet,&rsquo; Bishop of Toulouse, who had been
in early life a Troubadour, distinguished himself by his ferocity and
perfidy in the crusade against the Albigenses and Troubadours, especially
at the surrender of Toulouse, in company with his chief abettor, the
infamous Simon de Montford.&nbsp; He died A.D. 1231.&mdash;See Sismondi,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
